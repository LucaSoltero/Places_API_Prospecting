Replaced two toilets, cartridges for roman tub faucet and specialty hoses for pedestal sink.  He was very tidy and it was a pleasure to engage his professional services in my home.  Thanks, Jim; Jim is very professional and gave me a fair price too. He installed faucet to our newly renovated kitchen and he fix and put up a new pipe to our drainer. I will highly recommend this company. Thumbs up!; Guess these guys arent interested in small jobs. Got a call back at first, I guess to see what the job was. Once known it was a toilet tank install and a leak on the shut off valve...POOF he disapeared. Didnt return calls nor texts. After a few days finally got a text ill be there in the morning aaannnddd a no show. I just feel its 100% unprofessional, I wasnt getting the job done for free, I was paying. I guess the small jobs although not small to me the leak the 1 bathroom are not worth his time....; I had a backup in the main waste pipe going out to the street, before the trap. It wasn't an emergency because it was still draining a bit but quite slowly. I could tell because the sink in my basement filled slowly with water.  I called and let them know what was going on and they came out the very next day.  They did an excellent and quick job cleaning everything out thoroughly using a manual snake as well as a large snake attached to a machine.  Everything is draining again. The price was also very good. Thanks!; Had new dish washer installed in a non conventional installation. Job was done quickly professionally and in a timely manner. Also had a toilet leak also that entailed repairing wood underneath the toilet and all was taken care. I would absolutely recommend calling these guys for your plumping needs.","Jim was a very nice gentleman and did a terrific job.

We cannot recommend him highly enough!; Mark was great! Skin was completely clogged and I used every chemical and cheap snakes I could to fix the problem! Took him 15m to get the job done! Also yelled at us for allowing any oil and other things to fall into sink; Marek has been the most professional service provider for my sewer system since I have been a member of HomeServe. He was courteous, knowledgeable, and concerned about finding the source of the problem. He engaged with HomeServe to get approval to use his camera to inspect my sewer system and found roots. He then followed up with HomeServe to get approval to come back to my home to clean out the roots. His willingness to share his knowledge with me made me feel confident that my problem will be resolved. Prior service providers came and cleared my sewer system but the problem reoccurred within 2-3 months. The last provider came and used a balloon system that only resolved the problem for 11 days. Marek was also concerned about the cleanliness of his service call. I am glad I requested another provider and connected with Marek. I am happy to write this review and recommend both JVD Rooter and HomeServe for their professionalism and concern in swiftly responding to my request.

He arrived around 5:30 pm and took care of my heating issue  immediately. He was extremely reasonable and very professional. I can’t begin to tell you that he’s my future Plummer for all my plumbing and/or heating issue. I’ll recommend giving him a call if you looking for someone professional, reasonably priced and just overall great.; when we call Michael to fix our heating system which was not working for over 2 1/2 years properly, it was the best decision we have made. We had many plumbers coming to our home and they were giving us all kinds of diagnosis as well as severe prices. Now during this pandemic both myself and my husband are not working the hours as we did previously. However, when Michael came to our home and told my husband that He would not leave until the problem was fixed and solved with our heating system I couldn’t believe that he actually kept his word. he also mentioned that he would only charge us what he paid for the parts and $100 for the labor because he wanted to be known as the honest plumber.  I was so shocked when he told me what the bill was after he fixed every radiator in our home. Our radiator in the kitchen had not worked for three years and he was able to diagnose that problem and fixed it now it is given so much heat we have to turn the fan on the air conditioner on in our home because the heat is beaming and blasting thank God for Michael. because Michael was able to get our heating system up and running and working the best it has ever been. The heating system is working on every floor . We have three floors and the basement which makes four floors and all the radiators are HOT and full of heat. we are so glad that we’ve met Michael who is one of a most kind and HONEST Plumber we have ever met. Michael was not only honest and kept his word to what he told us that he would only charge us $100 for labor and whatever the parts where we paid for it he was truly a man to his word we paid only $280 and he did not even want to get a tip but he wanted to be known as the honest Plummer. This is an honest Plummer I am truly blessed to have met him if you were looking for someone to work on your boiler who is experience and will not charge you an arm and a leg call Michael. Thank you so much for being the honest Plummer; I was fortunate to get a hold of Michal on a late Saturday night during the recent Labor day weekend.  I called him to fix an issue that was caused by a ""handyman"" trying to fix a simple dripping shower faucet which resulted is a bigger issue as well as in turning off my water completely.   Once I called Michal, he was at my house in 10 minutes.  He analyzed the issue and provided some options .  At the end of the day, Michal was professional, efficient, dependable and provided a level of comfort that my issue would be resolved properly.  Throughout the process, he tried to minimize the need for me to buy new parts which was very much appreciated.  He also provided some helpful maintenance tips for other items in my house ( IE- hot water tank ).

Sean responded to my parents house who needed help with their boiler. He quickly and accurately diagnosed the problem and fixed the issue. Friendly and polite company. THANK YOU GUYS!; Sean is great! Very polite, patient, and careful.
He responded to my Google map message early in the morning, visited my home to inspect and scope the job, and gave me a reasonable estimate right away. The main job was to disable the moisturizer in the HVAC. Sean inspected the pipes, and suggested removing the needle-like valves that control water flow into the moisturizer, because they tend to fail. He also spotted a potential leak at a T-shape junction, and offered to replace that part altogether. The photos show the final result, very clean and well-installed.
Overall, a perfect experience although! Highly recommend AAA-Able!; This is a well run, organized, and very professional company.  I had a large (to me) leak from my sink that was going extensively into my basement.  I gave these guys a call, spoke with dispatch/owner, and they sent someone over same day to fix my issue.

When Sean arrived, he was very courteous, professional, and polite.  He is clearly very knowledgeable about his field and explained my problem to me in a way I could understand.  The fix went very smoothly and I was charged a reasonable rate.

I cannot recommend these guys enough.  Thank you again!; Great experience. Scheduling was quick and seamless, good communication on when he'd arrive and a very thorough, thoughtful approach to problem solving. He took his time to explain potential root causes of the issue as well as how the plumbing inside and outside the house worked and now I'm much more educated to diagnose problems on my own and understand the pros and cons of different approaches. My problem is resolved and the price was very fair, especially considering the different approaches he explored and time he spent answering my questions. Highly recommend!; Just wanted to take a moment to share the fact that Tom, Glenn and team came out yesterday morning and resolved a 20+ year drain mystery and problem that has, on occasion, resulted in lots of water coming into parts of my basement during crazy storms like we had 3 weeks ago.   They first came out a few days ago to diagnose the mystery and then yesterday they brought out a truck with a cleaning jet on a 200 foot long hose to blast out a cubic yard (!)  of dirt from my very clogged patio drains.   They did it very efficiently, professionally and miracle of miracles, I now am looking forward to the next thunderstorm.      After that Tom cleaned out and replaced a few 90+ year old pipes from our bathtub.

Just a super positive, super enjoyable visit from these guys and the peace of mind that they brought to us is immeasurable.

VERY highly recommend AAA-ABLE and plan to use them annually to maintain my external drains and do whatever plumbing I ever need in my house going forward.

Thanks guys.   Top notch work!

Edited to add (12/18/23):  We had a major storm in the community over the last 24 hours, a storm that would normally have dropped a lot of water in my basement.   There was none thanks to the incredible job that these guys did to clean out my drains back in May.   Their work is superb and totally pays for itself.","Great experience with AAA-Able!

Just had some additional plumbing work done in our kitchen - Mike was so responsive and did a great job at fair price! Highly recommend! He’s a true professional.

Excellent experience with a very old faucet repair and replacement. Mike is responsive, knowledgeable and reasonable. Highly recommend!; Mike was excellent from start to finish. Took care of one issue expediently and for a good price, then took time to walk around with me to look at other potential issues and offered great advice. Didn't make me feel like he was ""on the clock"" even after he fixed the issue he came for.; When we bought a ~100-year old house, we quickly realized that we would need a quality plumber. We’ve been using Fischetti for years, and thus far they have been nothing but attentive, knowledgable and proactive.  Installations of a sump pump, boiler, hot water heater, maintenance needs, etc. have been fairly priced (I’ve checked) and timely. Mike and Joe are great at what they do.; Communication was great. Price was ridiculous- They basically charged me $400hr for their work, ($600 total) being a simple pipe repair and a Furnace service. If they think they can get away with it - they will. Hard to find an honest plumber–they certainly are not. I'll be going back to Basco.; I called Joe, after our water-based backup sump pump sprung a leak. It was a panicked call, as our home was going on the market in days. He and Mike were at our home within an hour, reassuring us that we wouldn't have more leaks after we shut off the water supply to the area, and agreed to get us on the schedule for a deeper pit and new backup pump. They showed up as promised yesterday and got right to work. They fixed the issue and corrected some issues that the previous owners had created.

ChIJF04xd6ZNwokRkv7mWJWshQg,Genuine Plumbing & Heating,"50 Androvette St, Staten Island, NY 10309",3.9,50,,N/A,"I strongly suggest avoiding this company. They grossly overcharge and when the shower faucet they supposedly fixed started leaking again just a few days later, they would not take responsibility and said they would charge all over again to fix it.

In response to my review, above, the owner responded and said they strive to be helpful and if there's anything they can do to help, to let them know. They charged me almost $1000 to fix the faucet and three days later it was still leaking, so yes, they could help by giving me a refund. Will they?; Received professional and efficient service from both the office and plumbers. I called in an emergency job and they coordinated technicians to be onsite within 2 hours! Unbelievable service! Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a diversified plumbing company with very experienced plumbers and office members! The dispatch department goes above and beyond to ensure top tier service from start to finish. Definitely the best plumbing company I’ve dealt with.; Would not recommend. They triple overcharged me for a very basic service because their technician didn't have basic supplies on hand.  Their administration is completely uncompromising and I was treated very poorly.; Predatory price policy! Beware! I believed that this company would be honest and employ people that would uphold the pricing policy and the hourly rate by providing efficient service. Clearly, the GPS tracker policy is a scam and a means of up charging customers. I was able to lower the price in the end because I have time stamps documenting the coming and going of the plumbers, if you use this service you should be mindful to do the same to avoid being taken advantage of.; Beware of predatory pricing!! A very simple toilet repair will cost you over $800. Technician said he would get a part from the van (which apparently does not even come stocked with simple fill valves) and be back in 10 mins, only to return well over an hour later. He volunteered that I would only be charged for an hour as the job was “less than an hour”, but I end up getting charged for 3 hours. The cowardly office is not willing to even discuss with you on the phone…they just hide behind emails telling you over and over that the technician has no authority to discuss pricing and that you approved the small print of their GPS-based pricing, which they pressured me to approve while on the initial phone call with them in return for a prompt visit. 61 minutes means you will be charged for two hours of labor, and 121 minutes means you will be charged for three hours, and so on. And believe me, they control the minutes and you (and even the honest technician who is in your apartment) have no say whatsoever, even though the technician went to the wrong apt and got lost in my building! For all I know he got a coffee too! Beware of the small print!! An unethical and cowardly company. Other reviews have also indicated the same misleading pricing and dishonesty so this is not just a one-off criticism! BEWARE","I strongly suggest avoiding this company. They grossly overcharge and when the shower faucet they supposedly fixed started leaking again just a few days later, they would not take responsibility and said they would charge all over again to fix it.

In response to my review, above, the owner responded and said they strive to be helpful and if there's anything they can do to help, to let them know. They charged me almost $1000 to fix the faucet and three days later it was still leaking, so yes, they could help by giving me a refund. Will they?; Would not recommend. They triple overcharged me for a very basic service because their technician didn't have basic supplies on hand.  Their administration is completely uncompromising and I was treated very poorly.; Received professional and efficient service from both the office and plumbers. I called in an emergency job and they coordinated technicians to be onsite within 2 hours! Unbelievable service! Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a diversified plumbing company with very experienced plumbers and office members! The dispatch department goes above and beyond to ensure top tier service from start to finish. Definitely the best plumbing company I’ve dealt with.; Predatory price policy! Beware! I believed that this company would be honest and employ people that would uphold the pricing policy and the hourly rate by providing efficient service. Clearly, the GPS tracker policy is a scam and a means of up charging customers. I was able to lower the price in the end because I have time stamps documenting the coming and going of the plumbers, if you use this service you should be mindful to do the same to avoid being taken advantage of.; Beware of predatory pricing!! A very simple toilet repair will cost you over $800.

Ultimately, the sink was relocated, the appliances were set in place (not fully connected yet), and the outdoor drain was cleared. I paused the remaining work scheduled for the next day due to the poor performance of the plumber (helper was fantastic).

Also that there really wasn’t a leak under the sink but that one of the rubber stoppers for the sink drain was bent and he could adjust it.  Charged us 300 dollars for the tub caulking and sink which we figured must be the going rate, so no big deal.  Three weeks later the caulking around the tub was badly cracked and so I called Kyle the owner.  I told him it was a free standing tub, sent him pictures of the work that Gatti plumbing had done and he looked at the cracked caulking said it was most likely a leak after all!  He said he would come take a look at it himself and that it would be 200 dollars an hour and that he would refund us the money for the caulking.  He came yesterday, stayed for less than 2 hours and charged us 500 dollars for the tub repair (and 148 dollars for the adjustment under the sink).  When I asked Kyle why he charged us 500 dollars for the tub repair when he was there for less than 2 hours and based on what he quoted us it should have been less than 400, he said he needs to make at least 500 for a free standing tub repair and that because he is fast that’s why it took him less than 2 hours.  He said he could have hung around and pretended to take 3 hours if he wanted to.  When you are quoted one price on the phone and they then come in and charge you a different price, that’s completely unprofessional and fraudulent.

JASON'S RESPONSE ON 12/1/21:
Good morning, I will have you scheduled early next week for repairs. Sorry if no one got back to you. Ill send you an email later today with a time and day for next week to have this situated
HE NEVER EFFECTUATED ANY REPAIRS, AND DESPITE A DOZEN EMAILS AND EVEN MORE PHONE CALLS, ALL OF WHICH WERE PROMISED A RESPONSE BY WHOMEVER ANSWERS HIS PHONE, WE NEVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN.
IN ADDITION, HIS INITIAL INVOICE INCLUDED OVER $750 IN PURCHASES OF ITEMS THAT WERE NOT USED ON OUR JOB. THIS WAS DISCOVERED AFTER A THOROUGH REVIEW.
ANY RESPONSE BY JASON TO REFUTE OR DISPUTE THESE CLAIMS WILL SIMPLY BE A FALSEHOOD!!!; I cannot recommend this company whatsoever. I called them to install I new sink for me because I replaced the countertop. About 2 months later it was leaking. I had a feeling something like this would happen because they sent a kid to do the work. With no one to verify his work.

I called and the plumber was understanding. He sent another guy and he fixed the leak but then they created another problem. Couple months later I noticed the water draining more slowly. Now it's clogged and the water is backing up. I tried to contact Jason regarding the issue and I cannot get in contact with them. I called another plumber. The new plumber said the job was poorly done and definitely contributed to the clogged drain and water backing up.

Stay away from this ""company"".; Had service done today by IR plumbing. I called them around 1pm they arrived to my bar at 2pm. Our water heater went and we had to upgrade a few faucets. They arrived fast, They were very clean and got the job done at a great price. I will definitely be using them again.; I called Roto rooter prior to this company. They gave me a 4 hour time frame. I waited for them 4 hours and 30 minutes to get a price of almost $1000 to remove and snake my toilet. So I asked them to leave. From
there I called IR Plumbing and within 1 hour they had a technician to my house as well as better prices. Technician was very nice.","Called IR plumbing for my periodic gas inspection LL152. They put us on schedule quickly and their price was cheaper than all of the other company’s I inquired with.  They took care of all paperwork with the DOB and made it a breeze. I highly recommend and will be using IR plumbing again for sure.; I cannot recommend this company whatsoever. I called them to install I new sink for me because I replaced the countertop.

I called and they said their work is not under warranty so they will charge to come Out and fix again which will prob be another $400+. I understand if i ordered a defaulted faucet i would have to contact the manufacturer but for them to charge to come out again without taking accountability for their mess up  is very bad customer service. I am very unhappy with them and do not want anyone experiencing what I am experiencing."
ChIJSxtutsa3w4kRJnADQAWHoVw,First Choice Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning,"120 Liberty St, Metuchen, NJ 08840",4.9,1214,,N/A,"Today, I had the pleasure of having the handsome Elijah Deritter from 1st Choice come to my house and fix all three plumbing issues for which I had requested a visit.

Like all the personnel at 1st Choice, Eli was courteous, pleasant, and obviously competent.

As always with 1st Choice, it was easy to make an appointment. We had reminders at every step.

The whole experience was impeccable.; I have been a First Choice customer for over 8 years now and from the day I spoke to Ed (Owner); I felt he was honest and kept everything in black and white, a thorough professional and they installed my Heating/Cooling system at my home at Monroe, NJ.

I recently had an issue where my pruning guys had hit the gas line and freon leaked and damaged the line and was without Air condition for over a week. Omar Hernandez was assigned as our technician; and he had a gracious smile and was able to troubleshoot the issue and had come to my home today (Aug 30, 2024) and completed the work to perfection and my Air-Condition is now back on and my kids and I are happy. Thanks Omar for making a pleasant experience and loved your work very much buddy. I would definitely recommend First Choice to anyone who have issues with their Heating/Cooling systems and will be their customer always.

There was a confirmation email when the appointment is all set and they also send the technician who is coming to your home with his picture and it keeps us informed as to who is coming home. Laura did a great job in keeping the communication intact.

Thanks Ed, Omar and First Choice Team. Great team work!; I am usually very anxious and hesitant about bringing in a new company to our office for any kind of maintenance or installations.  My first experience with Dave from First Choice was an AMAZING one and we keep bringing him back!  He is reliable, knows what he is doing, honest and makes it a comfortable and fun experience.  Every helper he has with him was also this same exact way!  Actually look forward to having them here to doing any of the work we need!  HIGHLY recommend!!!!; First Choice Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning is an amazing company!  They installed my new AC, Furnace and Water Heater. Fantastic Customer Service by Laura! Laura was always able to schedule an appointment when I needed it.  Plumbing Technician Dave Gall has done numerous projects for me. He's amazing and always completed the job on time! HVAC Technician Angel always made sure my AC was working properly and always explained what he was going to do before starting the work.

When I called they gave me an appointment for the next day.    Turned out  to be the pilot light and easy fix, I was very grateful they came as quickly as they did.; I have been a loyal home service customer for over 20 years when they were part of natl grid and then home service I have had premium cooling and heating for all these years. I recommend to everyone I know. Service was efficient quick and on point with zero delays that’s why we pay all this money on a contract with home service.  But have noticed things we didn’t used to be charged for that were part of plan now are not! Always used to handle issues immediately  same day or next day. This Saturday we lost our heat and hot water, gentleman came next day said he didn’t have part and needed to order it is now Wednesday and we haven’t heard from anyone still no heat or hot water and I have an elderly parent living with me.
We are extremely disappointed that after years of loyalty they can treat people with this much disrespect.  It’s not worth having the plan and paying all this money when a plumber could have done the job on Saturday. . Going to reevaluate if worth it anymore which leaning towards it’s NOT. They will lose loyal customers with such behavior!!!!; Highly responsive to customers! Always provides needed service promptly. The technicians are fully vetted and are courteous and knowledgeable! I am at ease knowing I have everything in my home covered by Home Serve!; If I could give 0 stars I would. SCAM ARTISTS!!!!! BEWARE!!! I paid $250 for an initial visit in which freon was placed in my AC system. The freon lasted 5 days at most. When the next guy came, he found a different ""problem"" and recommended we fix that and get the plan that costs $300 to have service for the rest of the year in case anything would happen to AC and heat. Well guess what, by the time we called them back because our air still was not working after TWO VISITS, they came back to tell us we actually needed a completely new system and that any other services we needed would not be covered under the plan we had already purchased. It's as if they knew we needed a new system from the start but decided to play us for fools, since we're desperate in the heat, and now we have spent well over $500 with our AC still broken and we are not able to fix the entire system. A real shame in this world they have to play people like this, when if it were their home they would fix the problem right away cause they wouldn't want to live in the heat!!!

Thanks from me, the seller, and the buyer.  No escrow!  :); I'm a 10 year customer of this company and today they really let me down. Here it is 4 days before Christmas and one of my hot water heaters broke and my basement is completely flooded. So I call my long time plumbing service and I'm shocked at the lack of service I received. The advised the girl that answered the phone my name, what my address is, that I've used them for years and what my current problem was. She advised that they are busy and that she couldn't get someone hear today. I had no problem with that. She took my cell number and advised that she had to call me back. In the meantime I had to go out. So when she called me back on my cell I was not at the house. She advised that she needed the serial number off of the broken hot water heater because these days there are many different types. As I said, I was not home at the time so I could not provide that. I told her that it's a 1970's hot water heater. There is nothing special about it and that I would be looking to go with the A&O Smith one that installed when they replaced my other hot water heater the last time.  She advised that they are very busy and I may want to find another plumber to help me. She showed absolutely no interest in helping my situation. She put me on hold and came back. I asked if she could give me any appointment date, I didn't care when, and she said no. So what I am being told is that there is no point in time that they are willing to help me no matter how far off it is. I was not even given an option. This is very bad business.

Thank you so much SI Plumbing.; I had moved into an older apartment, which tragically had hardware that likely dated back to before I was even born. Luckily, it was easy and painless to schedule an appointment with Staten Island Plumbing Heating & Air Conditioning (wow that was a mouthful). Robert arrived on time in a bright and cheery mood first thing in the morning. He had explained that with older faucets like mine, you had to be very careful or the whole building could lose water. Well, good thing Robert is a professional. He even went out of his way to pick up extra parts at the hardware store. Within 30 minutes, he had installed two faucets, one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen. LOOK HOW SHINY THEY ARE! I am beyond pleased with the quick and efficient service. Highly recommend for your next faucet installation!; These guys have a sign that says call for a free estimate. I had a water heater problem and when they showed up, they quoted me a really high price, and when I said I'd think about it, they tried to strong-arm me by saying they will charge $175+ tax for showing up. When I asked about the free estimate, they said free estimates are only done by people who aren't busy. I called up another plumber who is known for charging up the nose but for proper work and even they quoted about 20% less than this guy. They also did not charge me for an estimate. These guys declined to match the price but they said they can do it on the same day. I was thinking to hire them, then suddenly they said their credit card machines are broken and they will need it in cash. Really shady because minutes before they had charged $175 plus tax on the credit card. I decided this was too shady and did some more calls, and I eventually found a guy who charges 40% less and they did an excellent job. I am out close to $200 from these guys but it's better than if I had hired them. Do yourself a favor and look someone else.

ChIJxYeZBKU0wokRAAYy_wkAb1k,People's Plumbing LLC,"551 Palmer Ave, Keansburg, NJ 07734",4,132,,N/A,"I had my Fall service and cleaning this morning and, as usual, the  technicians showed up promptly. This is my third year of being a satisfied customer. The first time was for an emergency situation on Christmas Eve when my furnace stopped working on the coldest day of the year. It was 13 degrees, They came when 6 other companies would not,
and Josh saved the day working several hours in the cold.

Since then, I have used them for winter and spring servicing as well as  another emergency call to fix my water heater. Other plumbing companies are not as honest and charge the maximum. Matt saw that it was a minor repair and did the job quickly, saving me hundreds of dollars.

I know it is really hard to find smart, reliable, honest guys like Matt and
Josh which is why the company they work for, People's Plumbing is highly recommended,  Don't make the mistakes I made in the past. Go with the best and the most reliable to get your job done,  Love these guys. You will too. Thank you People's Plumbing.; I had a little flood in my basement from a clog in my washer drain. the flood took out my basement floor which wasn't a fun moment. I called People's to assess the situation and they came as soon as possible.. Granted I live 3 blocks away from their home.. Anyway, Matt arrived and assessed the situation. He was able to clear the clog temporarily, but recommend that I add in a washer pump. Since as a home owner, I've typically done my own plumbing it seemed like a perfect idea. He wrote up everything and sent it.. Anyway, the update was scheduled for this Saturday 6/29. They were on time and ready.. Sorry for the long review. I usually don't write these, but Matt and People's came through and got it done.. Thank you, Steve; This was my 2nd negative experience with People's. I needed something simple fixed that had time implications. I was not home for the estimate, but got it over the phone and questioned the cost of the part. The part that was replaced (which is simple to look up cost online) was obviously marked up a ridiculous amount, as was the labor. I work in construction and this is not a difficult project to derive cost and profit from. They paid themselves a very healthy hourly figure for a job that took 30 minutes. Even left some debris over for me to pick up myself!   The first time they came out for a project they had to reinstall my existing toilet after a drain fix and they proceeded to chip the visible side of my the toilet AND then re-install it without informing me, only to also seal the toilet surround with thick white caulk on my tile floor that not only looked awful, but ensured I'd have to do a bunch of cleanup work to replace the toilet. Gave me $100 off the job, which I accepted as an honest mistake. You are certainly entitled to your overhead and profit, but we as customers are similarly able to choose and recommend others....when brought to their attention they offered $100 off the next project, we had no interest in money back, but the pathetic offer and explanation tells you everything you need to know about them.; The only plumber we ever work with. Sergio and his staff are top tier when it comes to diagnosing and fixing or replacing any plumbing/heating/cooling related issues! Extremely knowledgeable and friendly.; Justin was awesome, professional and fast.  Great work, I would recommend Peoples Plumbing  to anyone.

After washing dishes by hands for 3 weeks, I couldn’t do it anymore and got in touch with Roto-Rooter. They listened to the issue, noted down details, and sent a plumber over for me within 20 mins. Sal was the plumber I was lucky enough to have, and he quickly identified and confirmed the issue: my dishwasher was hooked to the cold water pipe (which was incorrectly done). He also paid attention to the water filtration system I had under the sink, which was installed correctly but it was pulling from the cold water pipe which decreased my kitchen sink’s cold water pressure to nothing. Sal knew exactly which parts were needed, went to gather the parts, and returned to fix the many issues here within 30 mins. It was like magic! He neatly cleaned up the workspace and walked me through all the work that was done. I wished I had called for help sooner, knowing how painless and pleasant the experience was. Thank you so much, Sal, for your time and wonderful help! I love my kitchen now that the sink and dishwasher are working as they should be.

They charge a little more than other plumbers, but you really get what you pay for. If you have an issue and don’t want to worry about it over and over, they are the right help. Top notch support, top notch parts, top notch work. I also love that Roto-Rooter has a one year warranty so if anything happens, they’ll come back free of charge to address it.; This was a very big stoppage Wally  & Ahmed didn’t stop until it was cleared, 2 days .
They are fantastic, very concerned, very though, and clean.; The technician seemed knowledgeable and thorough. However, I always find that Roto Rooter wants to upsell (if that's a word?!). They always recommend you do more than what they came for. The price to do the work at our home was $823. Ridiculous.

Without a doubt, I'll use them once again and suggest; Great work, Staten Island Plumbing! quick, effective, and adaptable. In addition to installing the water and ice maker for my new refrigerator and installing and removing my dishwasher, they also changed two bathroom faucets and multiple water shutoff valves. The personnel was helpful and kind.

Looking forward to utilize.; I called this company on saturday in need for assistance with a pipe issue that was creating a loud sound in the house which also caused the floor to vibrate. They contacted me and at first send out a technician who was unable to make it within 1.5hr and the job was passed onto another technican who came at 8pm that night by the name of robert. I had described the issue that it sounds like a pressure issue with the pipe and he went and called his boss call Steve to speak to me about pricing and that payment will have to be made before anything could be done. After I was highly overpriced on a quoted of $2800 for labor and material, and $1375 for service and inspection, he was unable to fix the issue. Instead he created a hole in my wall, claims there was a leak in the stems had to change it. I called again the next day to complain about my concern and issue and the same plumber came again to inspect the pipe issue. I called back the company over 10 times to raise my concern and requested for a partial refund and was notified that they are a contracting company that contract out the jobs to local plumbers. I spoke to Steve Colangelo the boss of this company and there were alot of going back and forth to address my concern and for a partial refund of the service that i had paid for which was not correctly fixed. I was promised a refund of $500 through zelle and that was it. It was a very bad experience as i was not informed that they are a plumbing contractor company that contracts their job out to plumbers which was very misleading and misinformative. I will not be using this company ever again. Also, for some reason the plumber gave me a different company's name which now I DO NOT KNOW the exact name of this company  anymore because I was given 3 different names in the last few days. Does this company even exist?!","Call was answered quickly and appointment made the same day. Roy and his colleague patiently explained and fixed all the issues. Effective, fast, clean, and skilled.

They contacted me and at first send out a technician who was unable to make it within 1.5hr and the job was passed onto another technican who came at 8pm that night by the name of robert. I had described the issue that it sounds like a pressure issue with the pipe and he went and called his boss call Steve to speak to me about pricing and that payment will have to be made before anything could be done. After I was highly overpriced on a quoted of $2800 for labor and material, and $1375 for service and inspection, he was unable to fix the issue. Instead he created a hole in my wall, claims there was a leak in the stems had to change it. I called again the next day to complain about my concern and issue and the same plumber came again to inspect the pipe issue. I called back the company over 10 times to raise my concern and requested for a partial refund and was notified that they are a contracting company that contract out the jobs to local plumbers. I spoke to Steve Colangelo the boss of this company and there were alot of going back and forth to address my concern and for a partial refund of the service that i had paid for which was not correctly fixed. I was promised a refund of $500 through zelle and that was it. It was a very bad experience as i was not informed that they are a plumbing contractor company that contracts their job out to plumbers which was very misleading and misinformative. I will not be using this company ever again. Also, for some reason the plumber gave me a different company's name which now I DO NOT KNOW the exact name of this company  anymore because I was given 3 different names in the last few days. Does this company even exist?!; Recently, I noticed a leak in my kitchen sink and phonedStaten Island Plumbing. Although I hadn't used them previously, Roy called me back in five minutes. He promised that by 10 a.m., someone will be at the house. In actuality, He arrived a little earlier. The issue was located and resolved in fifteen minutes. He was incredibly amiable and accommodating. Without a doubt, I'll use them once again and suggest; Great work, Staten Island Plumbing! quick, effective, and adaptable. In addition to installing the water and ice maker for my new refrigerator and installing and removing my dishwasher, they also changed two bathroom faucets and multiple water shutoff valves. The personnel was helpful and kind. Without a doubt, I would suggest & use them for additional work!; Not only was Roy prompt and professional, but he was also very helpful when our water heater needed to be replaced. He completed the task and arrived on schedule!Travis the plumber at Staten Island Plumbing I wholeheartedly suggest for all your requirements."

He gave me a quote and stuck to that amount.

He was very accommodating and understanding when, due to my car (garage install of heater) not being able start was blocking the install, he tried to help start it and then left to return later the same day when I was able to move the car so he can preform the install.

I totally recommend him to help you on your project.; I have a rental property with a gas wall oven that stopped working. The oven is 40 years old so I wasn't putting any money into it in the form of repairs. I had the old oven removed and ordered and received a new wall oven. I called Anthony at Precise Plumbing. He answers the phone. He fit my job into his schedule and installed the oven the same day. After installing we found out there was no electric at the receptacle the oven was plugged into. Anthony removed the oven so I could have an electrician repair the receptacle. It turned out to be a broken wire somewhere in the electric line, which was repaired. Anthony came back and reinstalled the oven as ""part of the job"" , no additional charge. He is prompt, courteous and good at his job. BTW this is the second project Precise Plumbing did for me. A couple of years prior he replaced both Hot Water Heaters in my rental property. He did a neat and clean job getting the hot water restored to my tenants.; Anthony was very professional, neat and cleaned up when he was done. We had a flood in the Bathroom from a broken toilet turn off valve. We are so grateful that he was able to respond on a Sunday & show up in less than 1/2 an hour. Did work in 3 bathrooms. We would definitely use Precise Plumbing again.; My water tank had a water leak.  I contacted a family member who used Precise Plumbing to install his tank at a reasonable price. I called Precise Plumbing and spoke to Anthony who assured me that he can install it ASAP. I was happy with the results. I would highly recommend Precise Plumbing thank you Anthony for doing a great job.; I recently had the pleasure of working with Anthony from Precise Plumbing, and I couldn’t be more satisfied with the service provided. From the initial call to the completion of the job, everything was handled professionally and efficiently.

Anthony arrived timely and was able to complete very complex jobs. He explained the problems in detail and offered a clear and fair estimate for the repairs.

The quality of work was outstanding. Anthony was meticulous and ensured everything was functioning perfectly before leaving. He also took the time to clean up the work area, leaving it even better than before.

What impressed me most was his attention to detail and commitment to satisfaction. He answered all my questions and provided valuable tips to prevent future issues.

I highly recommend Anthony and Precise Plumbing for any plumbing needs.

First one finished promptly and professionally.

Said he would return in a couple days to complete the second job and never heard from again.

We were hoping we had found a reliable person to assist maintaining investment properties.; Leon himself does good work but the men he hired to do our sidewalk and railings did a terrible job. Puddles of water every time it rains. Mentioned to Leon I was not happy with the finish before projects were complete. Won't fix the problem or even respond. Update: pmt was made 95% of the payment was made which I should not have paid that much to you at all. I advised concerns throughout the project before I paid you.

So, I gave them a call and filled them in, Rome stated to send my address and that he would stop by and take a look.  A short time later, Top Performance Plumbing arrived, asked a few questions, took a look,and quoted a fair price.  I agreed, and he went to get the parts and tools for the work.  When he returned , i remembered that I just purchased a under the sink water filter and asked would he be able to install it and how much for it to be installed, again he quoted a very fair price.

He went to work, and in no time, all of the work was completed.  Outstanding, a professionally high-quality job was done right before my eyes!!!  As a father of seven,I was very proud of this young man and gave him my highest rating!!!
If you are looking for high-quality work at a fair price, Top Performance Plumbing is the choice!!! Rome, Outstanding job Sir, Outstanding job!!!; Absolutely fantastic work. He fixed my boiler on a Sunday! Very professional and courteous. I will definitely call him again and recommend.; My kitchen sink drain pipe broke in half the night before New Years Eve - Ira came first thing in the morning when most other plumbers were closed.

We set the date and They arrived on time . They were neat , clean , and very organized . They removed our old one and put the new one in . Frank  and mike was outstanding . They were very respectful in making sure the floor was covered  / not to scratch anything .  It was done in a few short hours .  Just in time for the winter ahead . Thank you so much in hiring the right men for your company. It makes a world of difference .

I was surprised and pleased that they were able to send someone the same day. Mike and Keith showed up, assessed the boiler and figured out the issue right away. They went and picked up the part and came right back and finished the job. Everything is in working order and it didn't cost me a fortune! Mike and Keith were professional and efficient. I will definitely call Richmond Plumbing for help with any future issues.; Forced air furnace & clogged sink issues (Google doesn't allow more than one review for a specific business per Google account, so I've combined two):

My furnace stopped working from last winter.  Called RP&H after a recommendation from my next door neighbor.  The technician, Christian, came fairly promptly to inspect, found the cause (broken inductor motor), explained to us in detail how and why the motor failed (in simple, laymen terms that we could understand), checked on part availability, gave us the price, got our consent, went and got the part, returned and installed it all within 2 hours!!  Christian was extremely friendly, very knowledgeable, and completely helpful in solving our issue.  He also helped solve a decades-long thermostat issue we had due to the wiring of the original builder's subcontractor.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Second issue:  completely clogged bathroom sink - A technician, Carmine, arrived early in the appointment time window, which is ALWAYS a plus for me.  Our bathroom sink had been fully clogged for some time. FULLY, as in no drainage at all.  As he was snaking and taking apart the pipes underneath, he explained everything to me as to what was causing the clog (soap turns to grease and over time clogs pipes).  I expected to see globs of hair come out, but it was all soap scum; years of it  :-(  After clearing the pipe and two snake procedures, the clog was gone.  We talked about NOT using any liquid, gel, etc, because they can damage pipes and in my experience, don't work all that well.  He suggested a weekly flush of BOILING water, followed by sink hot water for a minute or two.  The boiling water, in essence, turns the sludge back to liquid and helps flush the pipes.  I have no shame in asking questions.  Being a homeowner does not equate to knowing everything about my home!!  Carmine was very friendly, knowledgeable, and did a first rate job.  Once again, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!; I recently had my heat system installed by Richmond Plumbing and I couldn't be happier with the service provided. From start to finish, Richmond plumbing was professional, knowledgeable, and efficient.

The installation process was smooth, with clear communication every step of the way. Richmond plumbing took the time to explain the system and ensure everything was working perfectly before leaving. The workmanship was top-notch, and I am confident that the system will serve us well for years to come.

I’m very pleased with their service, I will be calling them in the future for any plumbing needs.; 8/23/24 - I left a review 2 years ago, and the quality, responsiveness and professionalism is still great!  2 weeks ago Chris came to fix a leak that was coming from the first floor bathroom down to the basement.  Today I had to call them again to install a new valve to connect the water line to my new fridge because the old fridge died suddenly.  Shoutout to Mackenzie for squeezing me in today!  Thank you to all for such great customer service!

Jerry and Chris are great! Super quick reply after I filled out their form online - so quick I was shocked.  Excellent communication if they were running late. I appreciate how Jerry stood in my kitchen as he contemplated how to fix my leaking stack pipe problem without having to break through the entire wall.  He gave me the best case scenario and the worst case scenario and I asked him the prices for both.  Turns out once he made a cut in the wall behind my dishwasher, he could fix the problem with the best case scenario, and to my delight he even charged me less than he'd originally told me.

ChIJQ5T8h8BkwokRy7heN-6uSM8,A All Plumbing Heating And Air Conditioning,"104 Union Ave, Lynbrook, NY 11563",4.8,270,,N/A,"AMAZING Service, I would give ten stars if I could. I called A All Plumbing as we were in a heat wave and my unit wasn’t cooling. They came the same day. The workers were very knowledgeable and extremely professional. The unit was fixed and started cooling immediately. I am so relieved and very happy. Thank you A All, I already saved your number.; STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!

Our AC relay was tripped because the fire marshal was here at our building, which is commercial and residential, and had to shut things off before his tests. I called A All and they said it could only be fixed manually so they came, spent 5 minutes, and charged me $398. That was 2 weeks ago. Bad enough.

The next day the AC went off again, and when A All came back, they said that the relay switch was burning out, and although they bypassed it we needed a new one and they would order it.

This past Saturday the AC would not kick on but finally did. Then Monday AM, no air. I put a call in and 4 hours later no one had shown up yet. Tuesday morning was the earliest.

Robert shows up on Tues. morning and tells us that the AC compressor is shot and we need a new one. We didn't even ask if we still needed a new switch. We told them to get us an estimate.

Meanwhile, we called 2 other HVAC companies to come give estimates.

Meanwhile, we called 2 other HVAC companies to come give estimates. When the first company told me that I did not need a new compressor, I was shocked and thought that maybe he didn't catch the problem.

So I let the other company show up as well. He confirmed what the other guy said, but went further to tell us that the unit looked sabotaged. That was his word, not ours. The air filters had been removed and the strapping on the installation had been removed so that the piece would be sucked up against the unit and most likely burn the entire thing out.

We were livid needless to say. He then told us that it is unfortunately a common thing, especially when it involves a commercial unit where the tenant (me) most likely is not going up on the roof to inspect. He fixed what had been broken and charged me $369.33!

Before I let A All know what I had been told, let alone that it had been fixed, I called to get the estimated price for the new unit. I was told $4800 for a new compressor, labor, and installation.

So knowing that the compressor is perfectly fine as per 2 other HVAC companies, I believe they were going to take my money and not even replace the ""broken"" one. They would have just restrapped, refiltered, and rewired like the other guy and pretended they did a whole new one.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS RIPOFF!!

PS The photo with the strapping OFF is BEFORE the new guy fixed it... not after as suggested by the answer here. The guy took that for me as PROOF of what happened. The bill I posted was for AFTER and wanted to show people what it really cost.
And 2 companies told me the compressor is fine, not 1. And one of the companies services others at this location so they really know the unit. So there's that. Plus, we were told to keep it ON! We asked that question directly and were told that it would just circulate the air. So... another lie.; I don’t know where to begin, but you do not need to call any other company! They were beyond accommodating, patient, understanding, and knowledgeable! I dealt with a few companies in the past, and this is the only one I’ve worked with that I trusted. From the girls in the call center to the two owners that came to my small business during an emergency to help, it was flawless from beginning to end- I’m so happy that I found them! Their prices are fair and they genuinely care. Like I said do not call anyone else. The perfect company is right here!!!; Of course our central air broke during the hottest days. We called the bigger companies and no one could even get to us in 3 days, even after explaining that we had an infant in the house.

These guys came same day, found the issue and were able to repair the system the next day.
They are truly the best at what they do and they had the best price by far!

The workers were amazing and efficient and knew their trade well.

Will definitely be using this company in the future for all our home repairs.; Extremely helpful when I called having an urgent matter at our office building.

Responded to our call immediately and the work was completed in less than a week.
They kept us informed along every step and took care of all paper work.
Highly recommend; found joey from jpsewer on Google and he did an incredible job for us! job took one day and was super fast and easy, communication was great. will be working with them again in the future!; We were recommended by JP who fixed our main sewer line in ONLY 2 days. They did amazing work, great guys. I would definitely recommend him to my neighbors.; A guy on a FB group I'm in recommended Joe for my classmate's dad's place in Queens. Water was backing up. That family doesn't speak English so I had to translate for them. Scheduling Joe was easy and he delivered exactly what was asked. he's an absolute gem to work with and I would hire him anytime.
PROS: On time, affordable service and accurate quote. Crew was fast and quiet. Joe is solid!
CONS: None from my experience

Thank you, Joe!!!"
ChIJE8LPLGVvwokR42XInm9WDs8,"Long Beach Plumbing & Heating, Inc.","120 W Park Ave Suite 221, Long Beach, NY 11561",4.7,157,,N/A,"My mother had a pin hole leak in the hot water line which was easily accessible. I called long beach plumbing to get the job fixed. They charged me 150 dollars to just walk in the door and another 125 to do the job that took 20 minutes.  I feel like I got taken advantage due to  the fact that the guy is only a few miles away at max. I guess live and learn.; This company was taken over by AJ plumbing. Two plumbers came to clear a drain. They snaked from the trap toward the bowl, found no debris, but got the toilet to flush a few times. Apparently it was a temporary “fix” because it was fully backed up roughly 24hrs later…after no use (tenants weren’t home). I contacted AJ plumbing but they wouldn’t come back unless I paid again. I was told “well it worked when we left and that’s all that matters”. Clearly the line wasn’t cleared out - which is what I was charged $425 for. So, instead I called another plumber (CityWide) to clear the line. They did it the right way and removed the bowl to snake the line - as opposed to snaking from the trap. That cost just $350, and they used booties and drop cloths. He identified a stuck wet wipe in the drain and provided me with a 6 month warrantee, at zero cost to come back, if the line clogs again.

Regardless of my personal belief to see a job through to completion, there are plumbers out there willing to do just that. AJ isn’t one of those. I’d recommend looking for a company that provides a warrantee so you can have confidence and some peace of mind that your home is not at risk.; I highly recommend! I have used Long Beach Plumbing several times and they are always professional, helpful and reasonably priced. I recently had  a large boiler leak late at night, and Jon got here within 15 minutes and stayed for over an hour to get things under control. His guys worked for 12 hours the next day to replace and repair everything and did a great job. Super nice guys, very reasonably priced and always quality work. I wouldn't use anyone else!; This is by far the most professional and knowledgeable plumber I have ever dealt with.  Our Tub was not draining  so I called today.  The owner John answered and said he would be able to swing by to address my issues.  He called shortly after and asked if 2:30 would work. He showed up on time and fixed our tub. He was clean and made sure my tub drained correctly before he left.  I will definitely use them if I have issues again.  I knew I was in good hands when the actual owner comes and works on issues.  Thank you John.; Long Beach Plumbing did a fantastic job for us! They installed our whole house filtration system and drinking water system, as well as repaired some pipe leaks. We are super happy with all of their work. From the minute I called them, I knew that I made the right decision. John responded to me fast and answered all of the questions I had about choosing the right system for our home. The ease with which I was able to schedule the appointment for the work up until the completion of the work was a breeze. Everyone I dealt with was super friendly and did a great job. I will be recommending LB Plumbing to everyone I know.","This company was taken over by AJ plumbing. Two plumbers came to clear a drain.

I have been using them for over 8 years and have only the best to say about them. They are responsive, reliable and professional and always get to the root of the problem. Junior is a pleasure to work with.; I have used Sabra on several occasions for things ranging from sewer back up to getting a camera to snake through hundreds of feet of outdoor piping looking for a clog. Every time I use them, I am reminded why. They are always professional, accommodating, and friendly. Junior, who runs the business, is spectacular, and he seems to hire only the best quality people. I cannot recommend this business highly enough.; Amazing customer service! Amazing team! Amazing company that gets the job done! They work with you when it comes to pricing and they are very descriptive when solving any plumbing issues!  Management company service  to personal service , they are always on standby! Junior is the best!!! Sabra Drain &Sewer are the go to guys!; I am so grateful for Sabra Drain’s prompt expert service! My wife noticed the soapy volcano coming into our crawlspace, seen in the attached video, and I was shocked and miffed by washing machine suds spewing from the AC drain pipe! Martin came same day, diagnosed the problem in 5 minutes, and did a meticulous repair. We had grease and food particles from our kitchen and laundry room drain pipes lodged in the main drain causing backup. Our daughter is coming home from camp with 1000 pounds of laundry, and we are beyond pleased and grateful for the world class, clean, prompt and courteous, service from beginning to end.

Update: Issue still ongoing (NOT because of Sabra), we’re having to deal with a property manager & a first opinion amateur “plumber.” Sabra has continued to go above & beyond to permanently fix our problems and stand by the right way to fix them, instead of suggesting the easy way, as the other did.

Every time I use them, I am reminded why. They are always professional, accommodating, and friendly. Junior, who runs the business, is spectacular, and he seems to hire only the best quality people. I cannot recommend this business highly enough.; Amazing customer service! Amazing team! Amazing company that gets the job done!

ChIJQeIl3gBOwokRUPtd6sUWvNA,J.P.'s Plumbing & Heating Corp.,"116 Linnet St, Bayonne, NJ 07002",4.1,24,,N/A,"The service was excellent but the pricing was a borderline scam. We needed a leaky tub fixed. The plumber came over and noticed that part of the leak was an issue with the toilet. We were quoted 139 an hour plus parts. At the follow up, the plumbers fixed the tub issue and pulled up the toilet. They noticed a flange issue and put in a stop-gap fix of two wax rings. The toilet was set back down, and they left, all in about 40 minutes. We asked what it would cost and they said we would get an invoice by mail. We were charged well over $300 dollars due to some unspecified surcharge for lifting the toilet. The plumber told the office that they had communicated this charge to us, which is simply not true. The surcharge is higher than the price of a new toilet…

TLDR they fixed the issue we called about but charged more than double what we were told we would pay, and they did not fix the secondary issue they discovered.

EDIT: the toilet leaked significantly within hours of the plumbers leaving. I lifted the toilet myself, installed a flange extender, and then replaced the toilet (which ended up having a crack in the bowl) myself for about $190. I did this after watching a YouTube video. This, and the fact that the charge for lifting the toilet was never discussed with me, is why I labeled this as a value problem. Communication notwithstanding, charging double labor for unscrewing two nuts and lifting a toilet, looking into the hole and setting it back on the bolts is absurd.; No show for first appointment, used excuse for second appointment to rescheduled . Just regular techs needing all to be done for them, I am glad as it would most likely bit been able to fix issue since seems they dont like to get dirty.; I would like to thank Jp's plumbing for the prompt response to the condominium association, as our hot water went out due to the hurricane. They are very professional and trustworthy. I was referred previously because he is my father's friend, and I also had a bath tub installed. I was currently referred by management. Keep up the good work, guys!!!!!!!!!!Oh, and by the way, the woman who answered the phone was very nice as well.; I shopped around & they were very reasonable.
In addition the service was exceptional from the receptionist Pamela to the plumbers they sent to do my job.  Everyone was kind & courteous.  They did a fantastic job & even cleaned up after themselves.  I would recommend them to anyone needing plumbing.; I have used J.P.'s last year to replace my toilet.  Jay and Hot were great and professional.  Good value as well.  I used them again this July 2020 to replace the bathroom sink faucet and fix the pipe drain below the sink.  Shay and Rany were so responsive, on time and professional in fixing my bathroom sink.  Very good and quality service provided. The price of the service is also fair compared to other plumbing services.  So I highly recommend this company.","No show for first appointment, used excuse for second appointment to rescheduled .

ChIJqxYDpKVhwokRhIpvG3hL42g,All Day Plumbing & Heating Corp.,"214-38 Hillside Ave., Queens Village, NY 11427",4.1,87,,N/A,"They installed a mini split air conditioning system in my home  . I did 3 bedrooms a living room and my basement  It was clean and neat and they made it  a painfree experience.  I would recommend them to everyone.; If I could leave zero stars, I would.

TLDR — after two weeks, we paid $2,300 for the bad installation of a cheap, broken $450 unit that now we don’t even have, and no one is returning my calls at the company or my emails.

UPD — after one more text, I did receive my refund in full.

I found All Day Plumbing through Home Depot after filling out their HVAC consultation.

At first, All Day Plumbing was professional — I was contacted right away, and quoted $2,300 for the removal and installation of two through the window units. Please keep in mind that there was no construction here required, our apartment already has two units that just needed to be replaced.

However, the first mistake was when their COI came in late and to the wrong person. They rectified it quickly, but I had to make several phone calls before they did.

Then, they showed up with only one of the two units. Their mistake, they promised to come back the next day.

But the unit they did bring, the serviceman did not install properly. The sleeve did not fit, so air and dirt could blow in from outside. And after leaving the unit running for 6 hours at its coldest setting, the room stayed 81 degrees. On top of that, there was a pervasive smell of plastic that meant we couldn’t sleep in the room — the unit smelled as cheap as it looked.

When I rechecked our estimate, I realized each unit cost about $450. So we were charged $2,300 for one, non-working unit, a bad installation, and a promise of a new unit the next day.

I explained my problems to the company and sent video and pictures, and they took the first unit away. They promised a refund — that was over two weeks ago.; I was very satisfied with my hot water heater installation by All Day Plumbing and Heating and will likely use their services again. They were easy to communicate with throughout the process. The plumbers, Bryan and Andre, were very professional, courteous, and patient, and arrived early.; Leon and Russel were great!Very kind courteous and professional.They treated my home as if it were theirs and very respectful they explained in detail about installing my water heater so even though you didn’t understand anything about plumbing you certainly did after they explained. They cleaned up and didn’t make a mess.It didn’t take long to install two heaters. Great job no complaints. I would highly recommend All Day plumbing for ALL your plumbing needs; This company is dishonest and deceptive. They were sub-contracted through Lowe’s to replace my water heater. I ask them to install a 50 gallon water heater in place of my 40 gallon old water heater. The technicians were pleasant and completed the work quickly and worked neatly. However no one informed me that I actually was given a new 40 gallon water heater. They charged me a reduced price and just acted like I was miraculously getting a discount. It’s not until I checked the unit capacity and saw that it was a 40 gallon that was installed and not a 50 gallon that I realized what happened. They also had me sign paperwork that claimed I agreed to the 40 gallon instead of the 50 gallon tank. I called the company and they acted like they did what I requested, but after reviewing emails and listening to voice recordings they reluctantly agreed the work done was not the original plan. After speaking with Lowe’s and the company about this incident it seems there are no repercussions for anyone but me. I still have to pay the difference for the larger water heater, spend a day ant home for the re-installation to be done and use a company that I do not trust to re-do the installation. I will not be using Lowes or All Day Heating and Plumbing to do any future work after this incident. I definitely do not feel valued as a customer.","I was very satisfied with my hot water heater installation by All Day Plumbing and Heating and will likely use their services again.

He and his team were very timely to my facility and we did not lose production time whatsoever. They went above and beyond. I highly recommend CPS services.; Carlos solved what I thought was an unsolvable problem in our home: loud clanging pipes from the steam boiler system. We have had the boiler serviced/cleaned almost every fall/winter since the issues presented itself. We had many different thoughts and opinions on why they were clanging but no plumber/company was able to resolve the issue for us. I thought I’d be sleeping with ear plugs for another season but THANK GOODNESS we had Carlos and his team come by. He made no promises or assurances but after he was done, so was the unbearable banging sound from our kitchen pipes. I actually thought my husband had turned off the heat because I didn’t hear the familiar clanging but nope, rads were red hot and the system is working like a dream. I cannot recommend Carlos and his team enough - professional, thorough, and so knowledgeable. We have him coming back to work on an unrelated plumbing issue. He has our trust and client loyalty going forward. We were so impressed and I know you’ll be too.; Fixed my water heater the same day.  Fast and trustworthy. Was quoted double the price by another service so was thankful this guy was honest. Highly recommend!; Great Service!
After having gone through so many plumbers and getting the run around; Carlos and Jeremiah came thru and did an amazing job. Boiler is up and running, and they were even kind enough to configure my thermostat as well. Would definitely recommend their services if you’re looking for quality work!; Carlos came out to do some much needed maintenance on our old single pipe steam boiler that we inherited in our new home. Carlos was punctual, easy to talk to and most importantly informed and comfortable with explaining his process. Steam systems fascinate me and since moving in last year I've taken interest in learning as much as I can about how this system should operate from reading Dan Holohan's books. Having Carlos to field my questions with his trade expertise on the subject was incredibly helpful to finally fill in the blanks on burning questions I had.
If you're not as clearly fun at parties like myself, the one of the best qualities I can share about Carlos was that while he was cleaning my system and discussing some modern updates the system could include, like an automatic water filler or second cut off switch, given the age of my system (36 years) he wasn't trying to sell me on additional work and in fact advised me not to make these upgrades until this one bit the dust.
Can't recommend Carlos enough, the man knows his stuff.","Fixed my water heater the same day.  Fast and trustworthy.

I cannot recommend Carlos and his team enough - professional, thorough, and so knowledgeable. We have him coming back to work on an unrelated plumbing issue. He has our trust and client loyalty going forward. We were so impressed and I know you’ll be too.; Carlos came out to do some much needed maintenance on our old single pipe steam boiler that we inherited in our new home. Carlos was punctual, easy to talk to and most importantly informed and comfortable with explaining his process. Steam systems fascinate me and since moving in last year I've taken interest in learning as much as I can about how this system should operate from reading Dan Holohan's books. Having Carlos to field my questions with his trade expertise on the subject was incredibly helpful to finally fill in the blanks on burning questions I had.
If you're not as clearly fun at parties like myself, the one of the best qualities I can share about Carlos was that while he was cleaning my system and discussing some modern updates the system could include, like an automatic water filler or second cut off switch, given the age of my system (36 years) he wasn't trying to sell me on additional work and in fact advised me not to make these upgrades until this one bit the dust.
Can't recommend Carlos enough, the man knows his stuff."

Andy got the job done properly though he had to come back to fix a minor issue. He communicated well, was generally respectful, and was on time. The leak was gone and the new shower system works great!

However, he was EXPLICITLY asked for the receipt for the parts FOUR times and has still not provided it or sent a photo. After researching the base model parts, the following was discovered: Delta T13420-22 ($109), Delta control valve body ($39), MTF/FTM adapters ($35), and all of the copper pipes and joints (around $50).  He charged $450 for parts, but in reality, it came to approximately $253 with county taxes.

Therefore, he will get the job done very well at a high cost and is great with scheduling, but may very well overcharge you for the supplies. For a person who came off respectful and professional, it is disgraceful, dishonest, and unethical to squeeze out an extra $200, considering being paid $1500 for the entire job.

ANY defensive response in regards to almost doubling the cost of the parts will hold no water unless proof of receipt is furnished!

I have been satisfied every time I’ve used Austin Plumbing and Heating. They have always completed work on time and within budget. The work they have done has always been up to code and passed inspection. I highly recommend them!; Very fast service.   Extremely professional.  Great work.   Definitely using again.

ChIJ4eTvZqHjmysR86vvORJSMKE,BRM Mechanical INC,"510 Albern Ave, Oceanside, NY 11572",5,18,,N/A,"Billy came to my house today and completed several plumbing repairs for me.  I’ll say this about BRM Mechanical Inc:

1.  Billy came at the time he said he would.
2.  He was transparent on how much his service would cost.
3.  Billy advised me on several of the repairs and made suggestions that I believe were in my best interests and not necessarily his bottom line.

I would recommend BRM’s plumbing service to anyone and everyone.  I also wouldn’t hesitate in calling them again for future repairs or work.; When you need help in your home, it seems like your entire world stops spinning until you can get the problem solved. What you hope for is someone who can fix the problem. What you then hope for is someone who can fix the problem quickly. And then, you hope for someone who will help you avoid the problem happening again. With one phone call, we found Bill / BRM Mechanical and that solved all three of our hopes!

Bill was able to diagnose the issue and helped us to understand what was needed. He worked so clean and professionally that the area of our house he worked in looks better than before he started. He communicated throughout the process. He answered all our questions and even at the completion of what was a long day of an install for him, patiently explained the entire system to us and did not leave until he made sure all our questions and concerns were answered.

We have already recommended him to family and friends, even if just to tell people to hold onto his number in case they ever need his services. It is so rare to find a company that fits all the qualities of what you look for in a service provider, but BRM Mechanical is a platinum find in the plumbing industry. We are so fortunate to have found him and we hope that you will feel the same way now that you have.; Billy rescued us from a late-night major sewer stoppage issue! I called Billy close to 9pm and described to him what was happening in our basement. He immediately knew what the problem was and expertly walked me through what was happening and what needed to be done. Due to being away, Billy arrived bright and early the very next morning! He immediately identified and remedied the back-up and patiently answered ALL of my questions. Billy is extremely knowledgable, genuine and provides the utmost customer service. A true PRO and HIGHLY recommended! Thank you Billy!; Billy is highly skilled, patient,  professional, on time and cleans up after he is finished working.  I would highly recommend him for all of your plumbing needs.  Not only is he an expert at what he does but he takes the time to explain what needs to be done.  Billy is honest and efficient!  Don’t hesitate to call Billy for your plumbing needs!; We called this company on a Thursday night almost at midnight. We heard water in our basement and when we looked down our water heater was leaking everywhere. We quickly found the number for this company and got in touch with the owner, William and he instructed us how to turn the water off until he got there. Within 25 minutes the owner was at our house which we did not expect. He drained down the water heater, got our house water back on and was back first thing in the morning to install our new tank. He really put us at ease about the whole ordeal and was very personable even at that hour lol. We were happy with the price and will continue to use this company!

At that time I was provided with a price, it was explained to me what they would be doing and they gave me the date they would arrive. I was provided with a contract, that I signed electronically. I paid half prior to their service. On the following Monday, the plumbing team was there on time, they were polite, funny and accommodating.

He did a fantastic job installing a new shower head, which is working perfectly. I sincerely appreciate Bentley's diligent efforts. He also fitted a new kitchen faucet for us. After encountering a minor issue with the piping under the sink the next day, he promptly returned to rectify the problem at no additional cost. We ended up replacing a part and only paid for that service. It's functioning flawlessly now. It's rare to find a company like Adam & Sons Plumbers that doesn't charge for every visit. Their service was outstanding, coming out three times but only billing us for two. Their pricing is also impressively affordable. We will definitely be relying on Adam & Sons Plumbers for any future plumbing needs.; Recently, I bought a new dishwasher. During the delivery, the workers informed me that the previous dishwasher had a water line running behind the space where the new one was to be installed. The delivery team couldn't cap the line, so they had to take the dishwasher back. This meant I needed to find a plumber urgently so that the dishwasher could be re-delivered. Fortunately, someone recommended Adam & Sons Plumbers. They promptly dispatched a plumber named Philip, who was able to cap the line in a couple of hours. Philip was clearly knowledgeable, which allowed me to have the dishwasher re-delivered that same day. The availability and expertise of Adam & Sons Plumbers allowed me to have a functional dishwasher in no time. Fast and efficient, that's what you expect when you hire a plumber! The service provided by Bentley was incredibly helpful. And since they operate from Somerset, the job was done swiftly and at a fair price. I was left quite pleased, and found myself humming their catchy jingle - 'and wash your plumbing troubles down the drain.'; We recently relocated and were in need of a professional to install a new kitchen faucet and investigate a potential clog in our sink. We suspected that our grease trap required cleaning and didn't feel up to tackling this task ourselves. Bentley was quick to provide a quote and returned promptly to carry out the work. He was punctual, displayed professionalism, and treated us with respect. Bentley efficiently installed the new faucet and, in doing so, discovered that our pipes weren't clogged at all. It turned out that simply replacing the gasket in the sink drain solved the issue. Bentley's impeccable service and craftsmanship were impressive. As an added bonus, he conducted a complimentary check of our grinder pump. We'll certainly be calling on his services again in the future.; I had a wonderful experience with Adam & Sons Plumbers, who did an outstanding job fixing the air gap and drain hose linking my dishwasher to the sink. I was having trouble with water gushing out of the air gap every time the dishwasher was emptied, but I'm extremely relieved now that the issue has been resolved and the unpleasant smell from the kitchen sink has disappeared! Bentley and Eric arrived promptly, were incredibly courteous, and had all the necessary equipment in their truck to get the job done swiftly. Though their services are not inexpensive (the job cost $301), their pricing is reasonable and they provided a clear, upfront quote. It's evident they are skilled professionals. I wouldn't hesitate to engage their services again in Somerset.; I recently found myself dealing with an alarming situation at my establishment, the lift station was nearing a back flow situation. Despite my best efforts to rectify the situation, I realized I needed professional help. That's when I decided to call Adam & Sons Plumbers, who assured me they could send someone to pump the tank immediately. Bentley was the first to arrive on site, and he promptly pumped and cleaned our tank. He even identified a few objects that could have potentially led to our pumps failing. Bentley didn't leave immediately after finishing his task, he stayed to assist Colin who arrived not long after him. Upon arrival, Colin and Bentley assessed the situation and concluded that the pumps needed to be pulled. Thankfully, they were able to repair both pumps on site that day. Colin even went the extra mile to double-check everything after the repair was done, ensuring that everything was in order. In a surprisingly short time, about three hours from my initial call, the repair was completed and we were back in business with no back flow and minimal down time.

PLEASE GO TO HOME DEPOT OR LOWES AND BUY THE PART YOURSELF for under $800 AND HAVE HD OR Lowe’s professional install it the same day for less than $400 that’s $1200 compared to $4000. I even asked the tech if there was a receipt with the tank. He Couldn’t answer. Don’t be a fool like me. Check online for reviews & bbb. Lesson learned For future reference always get a second quote!!!!. I will be making a TikTok and Instagram video.  Do not do business with this company their technician will take advantage and over charge you for service due to lack of knowledge of their field.; We had a wondeful experience with our technician Jerry. He went above and beyond to make sure our plumbing issue was fixed. He water jetted our main drain line and after made 100% sure the clog was cleared. Will definitely use them again.; Excellent service and pretty quick! Very pleased that Roto rooter knew how to get at the core of the issue and that it was resolved without much hassle. The individual who came was extremely I knowledgeable, pleasant, and prepared. I could not be more satisfied.; I had a water backup issue, so I called them, and they answered right away. Within an hour, their technician, Angel, was on-site. He was very clear about the work he was about to do, gave me all the necessary warnings, and answered all my questions professionally. After he successfully snaked the main line and resolved the issue, a second technician arrived with a camera to identify the root cause.

In the pic: Angel; Our roto-rooter technician, Nicholas,  did a great job. He was on time and clearly communicated with me what and where the problem was. He got our kitchen sink unclogged in less than an hour.  it was more expensive than I anticipated, but the technician was reasonable with us, I really appreciate that. I would recommend their services!"

The boiler looks so good and working perfectly. There work is done with perfection and left my home so clean. Would highly recommend their company for your air conditioning, heating and plumbing needs.
Thank you Tom and Gary for doing such a Great job. Will totally use your company again. Much Appreciated, Jim & Linda MacDonald; I have been a loyal customer of Chapman Brothers in Cranford , NJ for over 20 years. I also am a Comfort Club member. This past week I had no heat or hot water and requested their assistance on Friday. They could not assist and told me to contact them on Saturday. I had a tech come early Saturday and resolved my issue in less than an hour. I was charged almost $700 for the service with an additional service fee of $139! I felt that this charge should be waived or minimized. Chapman refused my request and I feel that a good customer with a company policy should be offered an appeasement. I was not satisfied with their response and their service level.; My water heater broke on a Saturday so I needed it replaced right away. Aaron came out quickly and finished the job same day. He was professional, courteous, and knowledgeable. Great experience.; We had 4 HVAC company come in to give estimates and 3 were good while Chapman was a total waste of time.  Who they sent was incompetent, lazy, condescending, and likely sexist.

The other 3 companies were here for 30-60 mins each; checking out the system inside and out, taking measurements & pics, talking about the different models and makes and 2 gave us proper and thorough estimates within 48 hours- 1 is getting it by tomorrow where as Chapman has sent nothing. the 2 were in the same industry standard pricing.

The person sent out by Chapman was here for 5-10 mins compared to the 30 mins plus of the other companies.  He was incredibly rude, lazy, and had absolutely no idea what he was talking about.  He would not talk to me without being dismissive cause a man was present and it seems he only wanted to speak to him- tho I, a female, am in charge of the project and told him this.

his incompetence was not flying with me and I was questioning it all having enough knowledge on the subject to understand everything he said did not align with my research, the other professionals who I had spoken to extensively and have 2 of 3 estimates from, or the building inspector who I talk to frequently about the projects.  He wouldn't answer my questions but rather spoke about completely different things which were telling of how lazy and incompetent he was.  What a waste of time.

This was a person who does not want to do the estimate correctly never mind the job. His attitude would never follow through on customer service or go the extra mile and make sure it was done proper and he would have been miserable to work with cause he had no communication skills or expertise.

Edison AC & Good Tiding gave great estimates and another company we are waiting on an estimate for seems on oar with them so far.

Check out Chapman's yelp reviews- 3.4 stars for a reason.; During a brutal heat wave, my air conditioner died.  I called my usual hvac contractor but they informed me they no longer service air conditioning.  I called Chapman.

Rob was super easy to work with, got the job done quick, friendly and courteous, and very fair pricing. Definitely saved his number for future jobs if needed, it’s a relief to have found a go-to for help with plumbing in Astoria; My hot water tank / heater failed (like an inch of water on my basement floor type failed) and I found it at about 5:30am. A quick call to Rob from Astoria Plumbers at 6, and he was at my house by 7:30 and had a new tank, and installed before I got home from work for a very reasonable price (that he quoted me on the spot when he arrived, and was true to at the end of the repair)
Rob talked me through all the options for various grades of heater and offered rough order of magnitude pricing on each option.

I can’t recommend Rob and Astoria Plumbers highly enough to do work fast, accurately and at a completely reasonable price. Great guy, great service!; There are a lot of horror stories about amoral plumbers who price gouge and take advantage of customers who don't know any better. Any anxiety I had about that was gone after my experience with Rob from Astoria Plumbers. His prices are more than fair. There weren't any hidden or miscellaneous charges that inflated the final cost.
I was impressed with how efficient and thorough Rob worked. When he was done, I really felt like he went above and beyond because the product that he installed is actually much better and has more features than the one that was replaced. He also gave me some aftercare tips which was appreciated.
All of these five star reviews about Astoria Plumbers are spot-on. My experience with Rob definitely warrants a five star review as well.; We had an emergency with a clogged pipe in the bathtub. After calling several places and inquiring about price and availability we can say without a doubt Rob was the best choice. He was very accommodating when we requested a specific time  due to our busy schedule, and he got the job done very quickly and professionally. He also kept checking to make sure everything was working properly and he was very organized. We would definitely request his services again if needed, and most certainly recommend him to our friends and acquaintances.; Rob is very responsive and respectful.  He won't price gauge you.  We had a leak in our sink drain and water hose. He responded quickly and was able to fix the same day we inquired. I would highly recommend his plumbing service to friends.","Believe the reviews!

Tuminello converted us to gas, abandoned our radiant heat and installed a Navien, and ran baseboard throughout our entire house. They did a wonderful time and anytime something came up the owner was fair and prompt in handling and stood by his work. Since then Tuminello is our “go-to” for everything plumbing. We recently had them change our shower body upstairs. Thanks for  a job well done and keeping our water and  air warm! We are grateful for a job well done and won’t hesitate to Reccomend to friends and family which we have already done several times.; Mike and his team are some of the most talented plumbing and heating experts on the island.

After moving into our new house 2 years ago (north shore of LI), we recognized we had a very extensive and complicated boiler room (not to mention quite a lot of bathrooms) that was giving us some problems. We had consulted with a few plumbing companies in the area, including some of the bigger ones, and none were really able to grasp the complications of our boiler system. We finally contacted Mike and Matt, and they were able to coherently explain what was going on and what all of the issues were.

When we eventually ran into bigger problems with our wall boilers (a result of the prior owners not taking any care of them for a decade), Tumminello was our choice to revamp the entire boiler room with brand new equipment. They are truly experts at their craft (a lot of the technical aspects go over my head). Mike, Matt and their guys did such a great job and we're super happy with out it turned out. They always showed up on time and didn't leave until the job was done. Our boiler room is now much more efficient and organized and, most importantly, in working order (shoutout to Matt in particular for being a rockstar - he could be a rocket scientist for NASA; he also took the care to make sure everything looked perfect and was super organized).

We've also used Tumminello for non-boiler-related issues (e.g., sink installation, leaks, clogs, etc.) and they've always responded promptly (and fairly). Truly a one-stop shop for all things plumbing and heating.

Flooding Because Of  Terrible Work
A few weeks after George’s Drain service cleared our main drain there was a very heavy rain.  Both 4 inch plugs on the main drain popped, and the entire basement was flooded with 4 inches of water. The plugs were NOT put back right. I recall the service man giving the two plugs a couple of light taps, not enough to make a seal. I was distracted by haggling with George over what was part of the job. Six thousand dollars + many  important things were lost because of water damage. I remembered with little effort the servicemen could have put the caps back on the drain properly.

Flooding Because Of  Terrible Work
A few weeks after George’s Drain service cleared our main drain there was a very heavy rain.  Both 4 inch plugs on the main drain popped, and the entire basement was flooded with 4 inches of water. The plugs were NOT put back right. I recall the service man giving the two plugs a couple of light taps, not enough to make a seal. I was distracted by haggling with George over what was part of the job. Six thousand dollars + many  important things were lost because of water damage. I remembered with little effort the servicemen could have put the caps back on the drain properly.

THE SUMP PUMP THAT THEY INSTALLED WAS USED.

They told her with the sump pump they installed, she would never have to worry about water in the basement again.
Interesting that it's connected to a sanitary sewer. ILLEGAL INSTALLATION.!

Thieves..!!!! Scum!!!!!!!; My technician was Victor. He was great. He explained the issue and the different ways he could fix it. He explained the cost associated with each option. He did his best to make sure he did the job right at the best price. He was quick and efficient.

I explained to the dispatcher my concerns with the current pandemic and that I would prefer to enter and exit through a certain area and stay out of my main living area. Victor respected all my wishes and maintained distance and wore a mask the entire time he was here. Made me feel very comfortable.

I would use them again without question.; In the midst of a Summer heatwave our AC broke down. By chance I was directed to A-Absolute Plumbing assuming I called the number of our longtime plumbing company which was still listed on the Internet but was actually out of business. Anyway the agent who took my call on a Sunday evening offered to Send out a technician right away but we scheduled this visit for the next morning. Since the unit was very old we were prepared to hear that it was beyond repair and we decided to install a new unit. The information about the specifics of the new unit was not sufficient so I tried to get someone on the phone the same day to make sure we would get the right energy efficient unit. This was the only thing that didn’t went well and when the new unit was delivered the next morning I saw that it didn’t match the SEER I had expected. I stopped the installation process and called Gil who was very understanding and changed the order with no extra cost! We really appreciate this cooperative attitude. The installation process was completed the same day and the team left the place after cleaning up thoroughly.
This was a very pleasant and smooth experience of changing the AC unit within 2 days from start to end.
I can only recommend this company!; We have an external sewer pump that had given us issues for a few years until it quit.  A Absolute serviced it the first year and it was quite a challenge!  They nailed it and though it took a few extra days, we were happy with the repair.  Not quite a year later, there was an issue that they took care of quickly and with minimal interruption.  This year it quit.  The A Absolute team worked hard and fast to make sure it was replaced as quickly and painlessly as possible.  And they worked within our budget to meet our needs.  Good service - good work - professional personnel (and over 3 years we met quite a few of them!).
We would call A Absolute again!; If I could give this company a zero star I would. Horrible customer service. And always a rip off. The first time they came the plumber broke the plate that was on my wall and said they were responsible. They tried to charge me 450 to 1100 to replace the cartridge and I couldn’t do that so they lowered it to 350. I said I would call back. Now that I call back, they have no recollection of them breaking my plate and also of the price quote. NOT TO MENTION that it took them 4 hours to come.

Edit for response to ""business""
I am the building owner here, and this is a squatter-
The business cannot squat here, there is no business lease for this address in any way, shape or form- which means this business listing itself is invalid.

Additionally, the court will hear the recordings I have of the threats you've made to others while on the property.  I really don't care about the threats personally- but I have no option here other than to utilize your threats to remove you from the property.

Additionally,  as I stated- 145 Any Drain Does not have any lease agreement to operate out of my building- and for that reason- google will make sure to remove  your business listing from google, and it will become difficult for you to re-establish a new listing once you've been removed.

Will see you in court, or wherever else you want to battle it out.  Bring your guns if you want- I really don't care.

You will end up at loss, with no business left- especially when you're calling her a N and abusive to her verbally- with recorded proof- which I will upload to your website.  It will follow you where ever you go.

As a new homeowner this is not the sort of thing you want to deal with 3 weeks in. This company did all the heavy lifting with prices that were affordable, essentially saving the day. We couldn’t be happier with them. Highly recommend.; Appreciate this company customer service and professionalism! I had an emergency situation, where my main water shut-off valve broke in the almost closed position, leaving 3 family house with very low water pressure. After placing numerous calls to local plumbing and water main companies I've reached to Philip around 7:30 am. Phil's phone etiquette is impeccable. He assessed the situation and made his crew available for repair in the late afternoon. It took the crew 2 hours, in the 4 Ft height crawl space, to replace the valve. The craftsmanship of the crew is excellent!  Highly recommend this company!; These owners are the sweetest most helpful men in the world.  PERIOD; Big Kudos to Design Plumbing and Phil.  My Mother-In-Law had a serious flood of water rushing into her basement and we were sure the Water Main Broke.

Phil from Design Plumbing came out very quickly and Identified the problem  - it was actually the City Sewer System

Although there was no business for him, he quickly assessed the problem, told us how to remedy it, who to contact and what to do.

A true ethical, gentleman.  And if a future problem arose, his company will be my first call.

Thank You!"

Be careful of using this company. Parents called them because they needed someone to connect a new sink to an existing pipe in the bathroom. The old sink was removed and the new sink was already up in the bathroom. Minimal amount of work needed to be done (1-2 hours if they really wanted to stretch it out) ...
they gave then a quote of $900 to make 2 pipe connections.Like any normal person they turned down the job and the company tried to force them to pay a $150 fee for coming to give a quote.

My father then got on the phone with the woman who worked up the quote over the phone with the worker who was at the house. The only thing she kept referring to was the $150 they wanted for the quote and refused to answer any questions as to why it would cost 900 to connect 2 pipes.

If they wanted to refuse the job because it was to small that’s fine but you can’t give a crazy quote in an attempt to make $150 knowing the customer is not going to hire you.

To top it all off the guy that gave the second quote from a different company charged 195 to do the whole job and gave a round about quote over the phone; I forgot to turn of the gas somehow and smelled the gas leak.

In 2012 I paid them $14,000 to replace my sewer pipe to the city sewer.  They came, and broke up concrete that I didn't even want broken up, and charged me.  After one year the cement sidewalk stated flaking off because they poured it in the rain.  So now I have to deal with a sidewalk that looks like it's 60 years old.  Not to mention that I still have a sewage problem at this location, due to the fact that they admitted to me that they didn't replace the whole entire sewer pipe from start to finish.  They only replaced a section!  So now I'm $14,000 into this, with terrible looking cement, and the same sewer problem that I had hired them for years ago.

Thank you Victor, Sean, and Cherman from ABR Plumbing, we would recommend them to anyone.; Called these folks at 3PM for emergency leak in my basement, with water spewing onto electrical wiring. They assured me they could have someone there the next day between 10AM to 1PM. I called back at 1PM, and was told they'd be on their way in ""an hour or two."" Called again at 3pm, and was now told they don't have any ETA. Asked them if this was how they treated all emergencies, and they said ""its no worry, we'll just cancel,"" and hung up on me.

TLDR, 24 hours after calling for an emergency, water is still leaking onto wiring, and the plumbers are not coming, ever.; I have used ABR Plumbing for several years and all of the plumbers have been terrific!  My kitchen faucet was leaking so I hired ABR Plumbing to install a new faucet. Tony arrived early  installed  my new kitchen faucet quickly. During this time he noticed that  some  of my pipes were not installed correctly. He was able to stay and replaced all the kitchen pipes and the tubing for the faucet and the dishwasher. He was friendly, professional and cleaned up everything.  I am a happy customer and highly recommend them."

This morning, Tom & Joe arrived early, they went down to the basement, checked both sewer holes, installed a new sewer cap with no issues. They were here on time, they were professional and they got the job done. Everything went smoothly, no issues.

Setting up the appointment took a couple follow-ups and there was no confirmation call, but they did show up on time so 2 stars for that.  Joe came to find the source of a leak in our tenant apartment.

A couple days later, a younger guy (son?) came to fix it with an assistant.  It was a terrible fix for $1,200 charge.  The pipe protruded right where the wall is, so we couldn’t seal the wall properly. They also added two valves in a U-shape —- it was heavy, clunky, crooked and added unnecessary costs seeing that we already have a drain valve outside and a stop-valve at the front of the room.

Their pipe ended up freezing and busting at one of the elbow joints (those joints can’t be insulated). When I called to inform them, they couldn’t come until the following week to fix.  We were headed out of town and needed it fixed that week so we brought another plumber in to fix and streamline their sloppy work for another $500.  When I called to inform Joe, he didn’t seem to care and defended his work.  I followed up a couple other times requesting some money back out of principal for the extra $500 fix, but nothing.  Disappointing experience to say the least; They were recommended so I called and spoke with John, told him the issue with my sink and he gave me a price range and we set up time and date.  He came with another fellow, they got down to it.   It involved having to move my sink to get to the pipes due to very small space.  Very professional and capable.  I HIGHLY recommend and they will be my go-to plumber from now on.; If I could give 100 stars, I would. The furnace in our basement died on a Friday morning. Completely condemned. We had no heat in our house a day before the late-January 2022 snowstorm. I called Joe Sr. who came out Friday afternoon and provided me a furnace replacement quote that was lower-cost and could be installed sooner than a large national heating/AC company that services the Brooklyn area.

His team came out Monday morning and were 100% professional and courteous throughout the installation. The job was completed by Monday afternoon, Joe Sr. came out to check the installation and tie up some loose ends. Couldn't be more satisfied regarding the responsiveness of the owner and the hardworking crew.; We have been customers for almost 25 years since we bought our house in Park Slope.  We cant overstate how satisfied we have been with John and Joe Esposito. They are consummate professionals. Competent, friendly, patient and responsive. I wish all vendors were of this standard.  We recommend Hlad Plumbing without hesitation!","Years ago my dad dug two holes in the basement to access the sewer line, but I didn't realize that he forgot to place a sewer cap. I filled out a quote form on John Hlad plumbing website and within 30 minutes I received a call to schedule an appointment. This morning, Tom & Joe arrived early, they went down to the basement, checked both sewer holes, installed a new sewer cap with no issues. They were here on time, they were professional and they got the job done. Everything went smoothly, no issues.

We had an emergency on Fri afternoon: main water line valve broke and got stuck in a closed position leaving the house without water. We were desperately looking for a plumbing company to replace the main valve but nobody was willing to take the job. Plumbers either couldn't come till Monday, or didn't have equipment to freeze the pipe, or asked for astronomical sums.
We were lucky to eventually find Joe and JFR plumbing. Despite being contacted on Fri evening, Joe and his crew came promptly at 8:30am Sat and within 40 min the job was done! Quickly, professionally, cleanly, and reasonably priced! We got water and could enjoy the weekend!

Everyone from the office, to Joe and his crew are professional, friendly and a pleasure to do business with.; I recently had a problem with a bathtub that would not drain.

I cannot thank you enough for your service.; If I could I would give it less than one star; They wanted to charge me about 300 bucks just to turn on the boiler for heating. The boiler is up to par, so there was no servicing required, I just don't know how to light the thing to get the heat on. Again, $300 to do something that takes 3 minutes???! Consumer beware, ask around to make sure you are not being ridiculously over charged!!!; No! These people are NASTY AND THEY OVER CHARGE and the guy cursed me out over the phone!! Wth??? Take your money elsewhere folks. Not worth it!!!"

I have also uploaded the before and after photos at the bottom; I recently had my ceiling repaired after it was damaged by a significant leak, and I couldn’t be more satisfied with the service provided by Isaiis. From start to finish, the experience was outstanding.

The team arrived promptly at the scheduled time and assessed the damage thoroughly. They explained the repair process clearly, making sure I understood what needed to be done and why. Their professionalism and attention to detail were evident from the outset.

The repair work itself was exceptional. Isaiis removed the damaged sections with precision, ensuring no further damage to the surrounding area. The new materials used were of high quality, seamlessly blending with the existing ceiling. The finish was flawless, with no visible signs of the previous damage. Additionally, they took great care to keep the work area clean, covering furniture and flooring to prevent any mess.

Throughout the process, the team was courteous and respectful of my home. They communicated effectively, keeping me informed of their progress and any unforeseen issues that arose. The project was completed on time and within the estimated budget, which was very reasonable considering the level of craftsmanship involved.

I am extremely pleased with the result. The repaired ceiling looks as good as new, if not better, and has restored the aesthetic appeal of my room. I highly recommend their services to anyone in need of ceiling repairs. Their expertise, professionalism, and commitment to customer satisfaction are truly commendable.; Grateful for Isaias and his team for fixing our front steps.

Looking forward to the next project with confidence! Thanks again, Isaias!; I couldn't be happier with the job Isaias did installing my dishwasher. Our kitchen had no pre connections or space for dishwasher.  It seemed almost impossible to fit one in. But Isaias came up with some awesome ideas to make it work seamlessly in my kitchen. The result? A kitchen that's not just more functional but also looks incredible.

His workmanship was top-notch—smooth, elegant, and precise. Plus, Isaias is just a great person to work with. He's humble, ethical, and always on time. It's clear he really cares about making his customers happy.

If you need any work done around the house, I can't recommend Isaias enough. He's the real deal—talented, reliable, and just plain awesome. Thanks again for everything!; I just wanted to let you know how impressed I am with the work you did on my basement floor and laundry connection. From start to finish, you showed incredible skill and attention to detail in your work, and your dedication to finishing the job on time and within budget was truly commendable.

It's clear that you take pride in your work, and that you care about providing your clients with the best possible service. I appreciate the time and effort you put into making sure that the installation was done to the highest standards, and that everything was left clean and tidy when you finished.

Thank you so much for your hard work and professionalism. You made the whole process stress-free and easy, and I couldn't be happier with the results.

Best regards,

Abubakar Rana","I initially hired a different contractor for my project, but unfortunately, they failed to deliver the work properly, leaving me frustrated and with a project that still needed attention. That’s when I found Isaias, and hiring him turned out to be the best decision I could have made. From the beginning, he demonstrated exceptional professionalism, efficiency, and a dedication to quality that set him apart. He took the time to understand my specific needs and executed the work flawlessly, ensuring every detail was handled with precision and care.

Isaias was highly time-efficient, completing the project well within the timeline he promised. His communication was clear and consistent, keeping me updated on his progress every step of the way, which gave me confidence and peace of mind. The quality of his work was superb, and he even exceeded my expectations in some areas, showing his commitment to delivering the best possible result. It’s rare to find someone so reliable and skilled, and I’m grateful to have worked with him. Thank you, Isaias, for your outstanding work!”

I have also uploaded the before and after photos at the bottom; I recently had my ceiling repaired after it was damaged by a significant leak, and I couldn’t be more satisfied with the service provided by Isaiis. From start to finish, the experience was outstanding.

The team arrived promptly at the scheduled time and assessed the damage thoroughly. They explained the repair process clearly, making sure I understood what needed to be done and why. Their professionalism and attention to detail were evident from the outset.

The repair work itself was exceptional. Isaiis removed the damaged sections with precision, ensuring no further damage to the surrounding area. The new materials used were of high quality, seamlessly blending with the existing ceiling. The finish was flawless, with no visible signs of the previous damage. Additionally, they took great care to keep the work area clean, covering furniture and flooring to prevent any mess.

Throughout the process, the team was courteous and respectful of my home. They communicated effectively, keeping me informed of their progress and any unforeseen issues that arose. The project was completed on time and within the estimated budget, which was very reasonable considering the level of craftsmanship involved.

I am extremely pleased with the result. The repaired ceiling looks as good as new, if not better, and has restored the aesthetic appeal of my room. I highly recommend their services to anyone in need of ceiling repairs. Their expertise, professionalism, and commitment to customer satisfaction are truly commendable.; Grateful for Isaias and his team for fixing our front steps.

A couple of times when we've had issues after repairs due to our ancient 120 year old house, they've done a followup fix with no cost to us. Each time they've walked us through the issues we're facing and what parts they're replacing, never once pressured us into more costly repairs.

I really do appreciate the work you guys have done for us.; Two workers came to replace my water heater, and with the light of the cellular phone  they took a look at the chimney and I was told how lucky I was that the water heater broke because the chimney needed repair, and CO2 fumes were backing into the house. I was told they could install metal pipes into the chimney for about $3,000. I agreed to it for my family’s safety. An appointment was scheduled for two days later at 9:00 am. I didn’t go to work on that day. Since they hadn’t come  by 10:00 am on the scheduled day, I called the office only to be told “I’m sorry, we forgot to put you down on our schedule”.Very irresponsible on whoever does the scheduling. I missed a day’s work for nothing. 😡; I am immensely grateful for all the people that have worked in my house. They are thorough, friendly, helpful, informative, and above all knowledgeable of what they are doing. They have offered suggestions in making things better in my home. They do their job to perfection and clean up after themselves. It is a pleasure watching how they do their job. I must say I learned a lot from them. They are always on time! I will not hesitate to contact them in the future.; I recently had extensive plumbing work done by Guarini Plumbing which involved excavating 10 to 12 feet on my property. I was extremely impressed by their professionalism and care throughout the entire process.

The team was efficient, detail-oriented, and ensured minimal disruption to my family. They maintained a clean and safe work environment, and I couldn't be happier with the results. I highly recommend them for any plumbing needs. Thank you for your excellent service!; I live on the street in Jersey City where these guys are working for the past 2 months and believe me they have no idea what they’re doing. They have ruined the whole street, they have dug the whole street I think more than three times because they just don’t know how to fix things the first time. Causing a hell lot of trouble for the residents of the street with dust and noise all day. Now after two months when we finally thought they have completed the job because they completed the road, they dig it again cause guess what, they messed up again! Would highly recommend the city not to work with this company again.","We've had Guarini do a few jobs over the years, mostly on short notice: two water heaters, and repair of a steam radiator boiler system.

Given the emergency and stressful situation,  The Best Sewer Cleaning Services Inc quoted a super reasonable price and were available to arrive within the hour.

Two technicians gauged the awful conditions upon arrival and cleared the line within the hour.  Would recommend these guys going forward.; Adam recently did a expert job on my sewer line. I only had backup during heavy rain and everyone else told me it was the City sewer not able to handle the amount of water. My neighbors have identical houses and they were not getting back ups so it made no sense. Adam did a video inspection to the street and found an entirely clear line with the exception of a small amount of roots. He then did a video inspection all they way to the back of the house and found a 90% blockage. After a few minutes of snaking the drain… all clear on the video!

I only had backup during heavy rain and everyone else told me it was the City sewer not able to handle the amount of water. My neighbors have identical houses and they were not getting back ups so it made no sense. Adam did a video inspection to the street and found an entirely clear line with the exception of a small amount of roots. He then did a video inspection all they way to the back of the house and found a 90% blockage. After a few minutes of snaking the drain… all clear on the video!

The company was readily available and Alex was the technician, and he did an amazing job. It took about an hour at 9pm for the job. He was very friendly and answered other questions that I had within my house. Price was very competitive as I had three other major companies to look over before him. I'm glad I waited and decided to go with this company. Highly recommended.; My son and I have used Plumbers from Citiwide several times in the past 5 years. Always happy with the outcome. They were polite, knowledgeable and worked diligently & quickly to solve the problem. I highly Recommend them!!; Thank God for Mike Savino! Not just a great plumber, but this man could be a social worker AND a comedian.  We had a nightmare flood in our cellar and called every damn plumber in the city. 3/4 of them don't pick up the phone, the rest don't work in Manhattan. Mike calmed us down right away. Stopped the leak within a minute. No seriously, he did. He immediately knew what the problem was, helped get our sump pump running again, helped us get all the water out of the areas the sump pump didn't reach, and he put me in touch with someone who can help with the damages.  He calmed us down, and he made us laugh which really helped with the stress and upset. Very knowledgeable, gave great advice, and suggestions. And best of all... he and Citywide didn't rip us off. Very reasonably price... actually, for the level of service we received, I'd say it was a great deal.  Thank you, Citywide, for getting out here ASAP to help with our emergency!; City wide is amazing. They fixed a huge issue I had with my cesspool, now it’s even easier to get to. Tom is amazing, true, professional and honest! They came on time and had everything done in two hours."

When we first moved in we were shocked to learn that we needed to replace our entire sewer system, and after getting multiple estimates Samuel & Son’s plumbing offered an incredibly affordable estimate and also navigated the permit process with the city perfectly.

They also installed a nice storm drain in the basement back entrance of our home that SAVED us from flooding during the recent hurricane Ida, while all our neighbors basements flooded.

The new sewer system passed inspection perfectly and had worked great. In addition, shortly after moving in we realized our upstairs shower was installed without waterproofing or a shower pan. Once again, Samuel & Son’s plumbing saved the day with an affordable estimate and a job well done! Shower has been perfect for months and no more leaking.  We had a sink with a leak and cold water only, and they fixed both!

Last but not least, Samuel & Son’s plumbing helped us optimize and repair all of our old radiators, again for a great fair price and with warm and human customer service. Samuel & Son’s plumbing feels like they treat you like family, they are always a text away, and they have me as a happy lifetime customer.

Finding a trustworthy, affordable, and talented plumber in Brooklyn is not easy (we saw how much some try to rip you off with super high prices when you are vulnerable and scared about your plumbing), and Samuel & Son’s plumbing is a refreshing affordable and skilled alternative.

Highly recommend A+ company, and you work directly with the owner, and also free estimates. Thank you! : )

She had someone at our house within the hour to assess the situation at hand. That, someone, was Kenny. He assessed the situation and advised us that someone will contact us with a price. I honestly thought the leaks we had from our bathroom through the kitchen ceiling (already made holes in our ceiling) were going to cost us both our arms and legs.

We agreed on the set price and scheduled for work to start the next day.

Kenny showed up bright and early and on time with a mask on. He wore it at all times. He did all the purchases of materials needed, breakdown, repairs, and installations. What I was most worried about was the mess that I would have to deal with afterward. There was nothing much for us to do but to sweep a second time, wipe down, and mop because he cleaned up after himself, took out all the garbage, and took everything with him.

Thank you very much Gale and Kenny at L Richards Plumbing & Heating! If we ever need you again we will definitely give you a call.; I hired Mr. Richards to change a meter in my home. He quoted me $2,500, with the possibility of an extra $700 for a small coupling(which was ridiculous) I only agreed to it because I was desperate. The work was fine. However, the plumber never cleaned up the mess he made he left wire particles and broken sheet rock. Then I called and his staff was extremely rude to me. I was just inquiring about why after 2 weeks the permit was still not filed. I would never use this company again. He over charges and the service is terrible.; Ok so I thought we would have a good experience since my mother used them, but of coarse it was a nightmare. We did an initial walk through, I needed a kitchen sink installed, 4 expansion tanks and a hot water heater. Also new shower handles.

When they came to do the job, they brought the smallest orange expansion tanks I’ve ever seen and installed them without shut off valves, should have been 30 psi tanks. The price all of a sudden went up about $400 because I was only quoted for labor of the expansion tanks and not the tanks themselves. They admitted it was their mistake and didn’t charge me.  The kitchen sink was replaced but only trickles water. The previous sink had pressure and worked fine but was just old. We were told the sink we bought is defective (it was brand new from Home Depot) The price for the bathroom work all of a sudden doubled since the shower body would need to be changed even though they looked at it initially and quoted me. I said I’m very unhappy with this service I’m only paying 1k and I will be taking my business elsewhere. The next day, the heat and hot water wasn’t coming on so I called and Len sent out a guy that was very helpful.

They took a wrench and twisted open a pipe that went from the ceiling to the boiler, then one of the men got a blow torch lit it and put it in the boiler, there was aloud bang and a flash of light.They then said I had a gas leak and that a part was needed and this cost $500.00 and the total cost of the service was $1050,00. They said I needed to give them a deposit of $600.00 and they promised to return the following day, Friday. They did not come.

On Friday after I kept calling their office number about them not showing up and not giving me a receipt, they sent me an inaccurate receipt with the wrong amount on it.

On Saturday at about 11 am in the afternoon one of the men arrived, after some time the other turned up and they changed the thermostat control valve (the workers showed my daughter what they changed and she found out what it was called). After some time they said they were leaving. They said they changed the part but the pilot is still not staying lit, and that they see that the thermacouple was recently changed. Now they said the boiler was not working because the problem was electrical and they do not do electrical work and I must call an electrician, this was after they collected the check of $450.00 and left with the water running from the boiler and part of the boiler hanging out and uncovered as well. Later I called their office for a full report on what they did. they sent me the most fraudulent report saying there was an electrical problem and that they fix it and the boiler is working. they did not state that they changed the part that they did and they refuse to give an accurate invoice of what they did. I called their office again to talk about everything. they said they will TRY to send back these same guys to look at the issue and that if anything more needed to be done it will cost me more money!!!!!!!

They collected $1050 to change an $89 part (my daughter later found out). Absolute robbery!!!!! I am a retired 62 year old woman living on fixed income. You can imagine how much this affected me to have someone take so much money from me with a guaranteed fix and walk away leaving me with a broken boiler in this cold November month.

they made a big mess out of it. He knew exactly every part and how it was supposed to work. I called this company because they are on the list on the Crown paperwork.

I am going to use them to service my furnace on a go foward basis. Now I don’t have to worry about it anymore!; Fabio was amazing in servicing my unit to fix the issue I was experiencing with heat. He was very knowledgeable and friendly and came on time to the scheduled appointment. Would definitely recommend him.; Had infinite comfort done to service 2 furnaces in a newly bought home. They were able to reserve a time to come within 2 days and were very professional and knowledgeable. He gave me a few pieces of advice and minor concerns to look after. Price was almost the same as other companies I called but this comes with an additional service call in the spring to service the AC. Great business no complaints.; JD and team were phenomenal. Down to earth folks, fair pricing, absolutely insane turnaround time, attention to detail, and professional. They replaced a 10+ yo furnace with a new unit and addressed deficiencies in the system, while navigating the tight space. They were able to identify additional items in my basement which I was planning on fixing, and offered great deals for future work, all within the fair pricing I've researched online. Calling plumbers/HVAC folks always seemed somewhat daunting, but these guys made it easy, fast, and did it right. I sound like an ad right now, but these guys deserve it."

Everyone involved is an absolute pleasure to work with; friendly and professional. The guys are excellent technical plumbers and combine the skill with exceptional customer service. I've used Reynolds for emergency service (they responded on a Sunday within an hour) and for routine repairs. Pricing is fair and the work is consistently done right. Cannot recommend them highly enough.; I’m in Property Operations and have been for a long time.  I’ve used MANY plumbers.  But Reynolds is by far the best plumbing vendor by far.  They have complete respect for your home or office and treat it as it’s their own.  We have emergencies often and each time I call Reynolds, they do what it takes to re-arrange their schedule so they can respond promptly.  They take pride in their work.  I’ve never had to call Reynolds back to repair something they previously did.  They always have competitive pricing, yet the lowest each time and their work is top notch.  I HIGHLY recommend Reynolds and promise you will be taken care of both financially and a repair that is guaranteed.; We have used Reynolds Plumbing numerous times since we moved to Cranford almost 29 years ago.  We have always had good service and they have always been very responsive, particularly when our water heater broke.  The service we recently experienced went well beyond the normal expectation in my opinion.  We had been having a problem with a faucet and while they were able to fix it initially after some time it became problematic again. We were exceptionally pleased that they contacted the manufacturer and worked with them to get the situation resolved.  While I have a sense that they worked with the manufacturer because we were a long time customer I would imagine that many a service person would have just told us we needed a new faucet and we would have just accepted that we had to do so.; I can't believe that I didn't notice or heed the other review that is on Google. I'm writing a review now to ensure that no one else misses a negative review like I did.

Reynolds came out to assess the pipes in our basement as there were some leaks. There were 3 long pipes to replace, which means it would have been a nice-sized job -- we also mentioned that we need to put in a sump pump (this shouldn't determine the level of service anyone receives, but making it obvious). They came out and measures the pipes, charged us $75, and said that they'd call with a quote and come the next day.

My husband took the next day off to be around for the plumbers (who never followed up with a quote), and upon calling their dispatch, was told that his message was going to be relayed and never received a call back.

Shortly after, our pipes burst again on a Friday and my wife called at around 7:30pm and requested to the dispatcher that we get a call back. Once the plumber called, he made it clear that he didn't have the measurements and said, ""I'm not in front of a computer, I'm trying to have dinner with my family.""

NO ONE SHOULD EVER CALL THIS COMPANY. They are unprofessional, have no vested interest in their customers, don't follow up, and as far as I'm concerned, are schemers who basically took me for $75. I'm a Cranford resident and want to support local businesses, but as far as I'm concerned, Reynolds could go out of business and the community they claim to serve wouldn't even miss them. I plan to take this review to every site, so GOOD JOB Reynolds.; We used Reynolds Plumbing on July, 2020 to move some of our heating pipes in our basement for a remodel job.  During the process, Dan noticed some issues with our boiler and the pipes and corrected that for us.  This morning I didn’t even realized our heating system was on because I’m so used to listening to all the noises that used to come from the pipes when the system was on.  Now, thanks to Dan, the system is running to perfection and the crazy pipe noises are a thing of the past.  This is something that other plumbers weren’t able to fix for us.

The whole kitchen is dirty.; Even in the early days of the pandemic, they were responsive to a clogged main drain and extremely professional. They have been doing my sewer for years at a phenomenal price. No complaints with the quality of the work. The problem with tree roots has led me to use them annually prophylactically in the spring. Excellent service.; Left messages for 4 days.  Didn't get a call from them.; The plumber did a very bad job. I called at 8:00pm and they promised to come in 2 hours. I called multiple times and nobody called me back. I started calling early in the morning and still no response. I'm waiting for their response for 13 hours."

I left a voicemail and he called me back quickly. He came to inspect my system and said he could fix it, but ultimately needed to be replaced because of how old it was and the poor work the previous company had done. He clearly explained in detail what was wrong with it, and that even if repaired there were still some concerns about performance and safety. We ultimately had Mike replace our system and he finished the job in one week without any problems. Most importantly he was on time every single day and worked full days to ensure completion. He explained every step along the way and made sure to always clean up and respect our home. He's easy to talk to, trustworthy, and simply works as if he's working in his own home. It was a relief to find someone as skilled as him and someone I could rely on to get the job done. Our new system is incredibly efficient and works great. He even helped troubleshoot a radiator that hasn't worked in years and now it works fine. I recommend Mike without hesitation.; There was a leak issue with my sink pipe and I've reached out to Michael to obtain a quote. He offered a reasonable price and he showed up on time to do the work. He explained me to the problem at hand and went through the process on how to fix it. He tested the kitchen pipes multiple times before he left to ensure there was no issue. However, the pipe started leaking the same day again. When I informed him about it, he came back the same day to fix the problem. He retested it multiple times again and I've never had an issue since then. Michael was a professional through and through and I appreciate his honesty. I'll definitely be using him again!; We were in a very difficult situation: it was winter, and a heating pipe had broken in an unidentifiable place behind a wall, or underground, in our basement apartment. The heat had to be turned off for our whole 4-unit building. Two other very reputable companies both told us we had to rip out our entire kitchen(!) to find the break and fix it. We were facing a huge expense and a complete disruption in our lives. Michael Donahue came over and immediately identified an entirely different way of solving the problem. He explained it very patiently to everyone in our building, came the next day, completed the job in a single day, restoring heat to our building with no demolition at all! He is truly in a league of his own. He charges fairly: you will pay top dollar, but it is worth every penny. In our case, he literally saved us at least $25K in collateral expenses.; Our building lost hot water on the weekend. He came on a Saturday when no one else would take my call. He was communicative from the start and went the extra mile while on-site. He got the hot water heater working again also discovered and stayed late to fix another issue. I greatly appreciate his help and would call him again in future.; I contacted Mike because my heater was running sporadically.  He answered promptly and was able to squeeze me in 2 day time and diagnosed the problem with my boiler in 5 minutes.  He was able to fix the problem so I can get heat for now and told me if it breaks, he will return with the replacement part if it breaks.

He is efficient and honest.  I won't hesitate to use him for all my repairs.

We were surprised they didn't have a cart or straps to help them carry the new one up 5 flights of stairs, and in hauling away the old one, they caused considerable damage. The floor in our apartment was scratched, and they then scraped the carpet and actually gauged holes all the way down a carpeted 5th floor walkup... We understand accidents can happen - but their customer service has been appalling. They say on their website they have insurance etc but we have had NO response from Larry, the Manager, and keep being told he will call us but he hasn't.

They were not only more affordable than others but also exceptionally knowledgeable. Choosing them feels like the right decision—I'm even hiring them for another property's furnace service. Their knowledge and honesty make them a highly recommended choice.; Called Park Slope Heating Brooklyn, to help bleed some hot water radiators that were not heating and readjust pressure. This is a simple job that takes 30 min.

First, this listing appears to be a call forwarding center, which forwards the call to other companies, nothing wrong with that. So, AllTime Plumbing Solutions calls me back. Which is great, atleast I got a callback from a plumbing/heating company in Brooklyn.

Second, the guy comes unannounced, no call ahead or scheduling...and insists he need access to the basement, without even checking the radiators or entering the house.  I couldn't provide basement access at that point in time, so I asked if he can come back in a few hrs. They insist I have to pay the minimum service fee of $100 even though the guy never entered the house. Ok fine.

Third, they come back after making multiple calls in the evening. And within 1 minute, the guy says there is nothing to do at the boiler, need to adjust the radiators (duh!). Then he says the job will take a ONLY A FEW MINUTES, but he needs to call his office to give me a quote. The office says $575 for a few minutes' job because it is a flat fee for any adjustments.

Positive: The guy who came was courteous and honest, and they did show up close to the time they suggested... which is all positive.

Negative: However, 575 dollars for a few minutes' job is highway robbery. I expect plumbers and HVAC in NYC to charge an arm and a leg, but this well beyond that. This operation's plan is to make quick money for minimum fee for showing up and hook you into ridiculous charges for actually doing the work.; We booked a service for a kitchen sink that was not draining, and the company was able to quickly send the tech, Ahmed out.

Lo and behold, the problem worsened and when I tried to call the company again they have ignored my calls.

Technician Marvin Johns was very professional, followed up to my calls promptly and was patient in answering my question. Would highly recommend Stanley Louis  as there office people also are prompt in following up when called.; This is my first ever Google Review so that alone should say a lot. I called SLP&H at random along with a bunch of other companies when I had an issue with my tankless heater. They were the only ones that were able to schedule a tech quickly, so I went with them. The tech who came, Mr. Wilson, was extremely knowledgeable and patient. He fixed my issue and also diagnosed some new potential future issues and suggested I call back for a follow up appointment. While it did take many weeks to get the quotes and an appointment on the books, the staff in the office always picked up and were polite. When I finally had Mr. Wilson return, he performed the maintenance with an amount of professionalism and courtesy I RARELY see these days in the service sector.   A day or so later, I had a new, rather urgent issue arise, and Mr. Wilson came to my house in the rain at 9pm to solve the problem. While I can't really compare the prices they charge with other companies (as I have never used others) I will say the prices did not seem cheap... But the job was well done, and I would not hesitate a moment to recommend Mr. Wilson himself for any of your Tankless water/heater needs.; I've been calling Stanley Lewis for a few years and I have always been happy with the service but today made me want to write a review because their employee, Wilson went above and beyond.

We had a horrible leak stemming from our boiler that flooded our neighbors basement and shut off our heat. Wilson made it a priority (and worked overtime, well into the night), to get the job done in 1 day.   I typically don't expect this type of service from any plumbing or construction company.

Shanie, Shawn amd Karen kept me updated at every stage of the project until the successful closure. And of course, Dale, who effeciently completed the work. Call this company for any heating and plumbing work. 👍; I am most satisfied with the install of my Honeywell WIFI thermostat. I am now able to manage my heat from out of town. Technician Marvin Johns was very professional, followed up to my calls promptly and was patient in answering my question. Would highly recommend Stanley Louis  as there office people also are prompt in following up when called.; I've been calling Stanley Lewis for a few years and I have always been happy with the service but today made me want to write a review because their employee, Wilson went above and beyond.

We had a horrible leak stemming from our boiler that flooded our neighbors basement and shut off our heat. Wilson made it a priority (and worked overtime, well into the night), to get the job done in 1 day.   I typically don't expect this type of service from any plumbing or construction company. I'm so grateful- Thank you.; This is my first ever Google Review so that alone should say a lot. I called SLP&H at random along with a bunch of other companies when I had an issue with my tankless heater. They were the only ones that were able to schedule a tech quickly, so I went with them. The tech who came, Mr. Wilson, was extremely knowledgeable and patient. He fixed my issue and also diagnosed some new potential future issues and suggested I call back for a follow up appointment. While it did take many weeks to get the quotes and an appointment on the books, the staff in the office always picked up and were polite. When I finally had Mr. Wilson return, he performed the maintenance with an amount of professionalism and courtesy I RARELY see these days in the service sector.   A day or so later, I had a new, rather urgent issue arise, and Mr. Wilson came to my house in the rain at 9pm to solve the problem. While I can't really compare the prices they charge with other companies (as I have never used others) I will say the prices did not seem cheap... But the job was well done, and I would not hesitate a moment to recommend Mr. Wilson himself for any of your Tankless water/heater needs."

I had a new sink and faucet installed in Dec 2021, and just today had to pay $300 to another plumber to fix their sloppy installation.  Less than 3 years after Kew-Forest did my plumbing there were parts entirely corroded due to incorrect installation, creating a leak that disrupted the entire sink area. Disappointing for a licensed plumbing team. I would not hire them again.; *This review pertains to a job I had done recently by Kew Forest Plumbing. I removed the old bathtub myself, so Kew Forest Plumbing is not responsible for any of the Sheetrock, tile work etc.

I reached out to Kew Forest Plumbing to install a new bathtub.  They sent someone to measure and the owner gave me an estimate. I agreed and they were there the same week with all the materials. I was working that day and unable to supervise.
I came to check when the job was complete and was surprised to see the tub was smaller than the space originally measured. In addition, it was sitting on shims. This was not discussed with me. I paid cash in full because I was sure they would resolve this issue. That turned out to be a mistake. I went back and forth via email with the owner and his story changed multiple times. Ultimately, he wanted to charge me again to resolve the issue. I refused and he finally wished me luck and ended the conversation.

They measured 60 x 32. You can see from the wood exposed below which they installed. The tub installed was 60 x 30. They suggested  I pour concrete to fill in the two inch gap. The tub is not sturdy because its on shims and its also way too narrow for the space.

I authorized them to do the job without asking any questions because I trusted them. They've done great work for me before. They dropped the ball on this one.; Tommy and AJ were phenomenal!

No mess! Great work! Before leaving they made sure everything was running well. In addition the electrician who also installed our new thermostat and took care of our boiler’s electric work was also great. This goes to show that the contractors Kew Forest Plumbing and Heating surround themselves with are as professional and good. I highly recommend Kew Forest plumbing and heating. Thank you Tommy,  AJ and Paul.; Tommy came and helped us getting our boiler working again. The smart thermostat stopped working with our old style boiler. Tommy was able to figure out a way around to make it work. He fixed another issue 2 years ago, a true miracle worker. Tommy and his Key Forest teammates are always very knowledgeable, professional and courteous. They are my go to shop, extremely happy with them.; Good communication and fair prices but poor work. I had a new sink and faucet installed in Dec 2021, and just today had to pay $300 to another plumber to fix their sloppy installation.  Less than 3 years after Kew-Forest did my plumbing there were parts entirely corroded due to incorrect installation, creating a leak that disrupted the entire sink area. Disappointing for a licensed plumbing team. I would not hire them again.; Tommy and AJ were phenomenal! They took on a huge job and got it done quickly and with minimal impact on the surrounding areas of the house.; *This review pertains to a job I had done recently by Kew Forest Plumbing. I removed the old bathtub myself, so Kew Forest Plumbing is not responsible for any of the Sheetrock, tile work etc.

I reached out to Kew Forest Plumbing to install a new bathtub.  They sent someone to measure and the owner gave me an estimate. I agreed and they were there the same week with all the materials. I was working that day and unable to supervise.
I came to check when the job was complete and was surprised to see the tub was smaller than the space originally measured. In addition, it was sitting on shims. This was not discussed with me. I paid cash in full because I was sure they would resolve this issue. That turned out to be a mistake. I went back and forth via email with the owner and his story changed multiple times. Ultimately, he wanted to charge me again to resolve the issue. I refused and he finally wished me luck and ended the conversation.

They measured 60 x 32. You can see from the wood exposed below which they installed. The tub installed was 60 x 30. They suggested  I pour concrete to fill in the two inch gap. The tub is not sturdy because its on shims and its also way too narrow for the space.

I authorized them to do the job without asking any questions because I trusted them. They've done great work for me before. They dropped the ball on this one."

He's a great communicator and problem solver. My vintage flushometer broke and I couldn't find a replacement nor could I flush my toilet. Based on my photos, Jack researched and identified two potential options and then quickly replaced the old flushometer with a modern solution while leaving my 1920s subway tiles intact. He also fixed all my other plumbing needs on the same visit, replacing my leaky old kitchen and bathroom faucets. I was initially hesitant because Bek Plumbing was had no reviews online but now they're my go-to choice for NYC plumbing. Thank you Jack and team!; Highly recommend!!!
I cannot begin to tell you how great Jack is.  He came over on the same day and looked at the toilet and took measurements.  And 2 days later, he came to install it.  He was on time and very pleasant to work with.  He is a very honest person.  At first, he said, let me take a look.  It could be an easy fix if the water is just back flowing.  You don’t need a new toilet.  But I insisted it’s an old toilet, and would just like to replace the whole thing.  Peace of mind.  You can tell Jack takes pride in his work.  He left the area cleaned and took out the old toilet to the garbage area.
After all that was one, he also helped my dad cut and replaced his drop ceiling in his bathroom.  That was so kind of him.  He didn’t have to, but went out of his way to help him.  That meant a lot to me.
I would definitely use Jack at Bek Plumbing & Heating again.  His phone number is permanently in my contact list.

The service person who was very polite and professional was clearly learning on the job and was calling Jerry - the owner the entire job to be walked through the installation. He was there about 2 hours and charged me $875, which I consider and exorbitant price as clearly the person he sent was training in heating and I should not have been charged for training time.

If I had hired them myself I’d be suing them to supersede the job and make them pay for another plumber to finish it.; ; bad service not professional ill not work with this company again; warning -I hire jack the owner he did half job  and ask for full amount didn't answer the phone and put lien on the property he have bad attitude and try take advantage on u  stay away from him and his company save your money and the headache; This is such a great company! Fast and reliable work with some of the most amazing workers. Very friendly and proper.

I have never used them before and now I see why they have such amazing reviews. Definitely a big fan of these guys and this company for sure.; Larry has been to our house several times.

B. D. Bills; All Day Piping Sewer & Drain was amazing. The team was professional, on-time, and really worked with me on pricing.

We used them for our home inspection, and when we finally got the house, because we wanted to get ahead of any future problems, used them to descale the sewer line. They accommodated me into their schedule, arrived promptly at 9am, and were really professional all-around. Often times, with these services, you're either using them because of a critical problem or doing preventative work -- which makes it harder to make decisions of whether an investment is worth it. Nick and team were upfront and transparent about the process, making it much easier for us.

I'm really happy with their services, and would highly recommend them!; I never write reviews even when I have a good experience. The support Nick and his team provided was simply exceptional.

They were friendly, polite and very patient in answering all of our questions.  They also completed this large project very quickly. All of the work was done from the inside of the house, and when they left, the house was cleaner than when they arrived.
Diego H. needed to install a dedicated circuit for a dehumidifier in the crawl space.  He was (as always) quick, efficient and friendly.  And like his colleagues, everything was spotless after he finished.; Service technician was great, professional.

Provided an estimate to snake the line of $500 (way too expensive for me). When I passed on the estimate, I was asked to pay a $59 on-site fee which was not stated on the phone when I scheduled the appointment.

If I was richer, I would definitely use Pipe Works. The plumber was very professional and wore booties; Delroy was efficient, thorough, trustworthy & super kind.  He gave two price point options to fix our kitchen sink with no pressure on which one to choose. He simply presented option A vs Option B.

(Before & after pictures included); My old central air system died after 21 years. I got several quotes. My quote from Pipe Works was not the cheapest, nor the most expensive either. But the quality of the service was impeccable!

Perry Mandarakas is one of their engineers/sales people. He measured everything about my old system and then explained in detail how he was designing the new system why he did it that way. He went over what would stay, what would be replaced and why. It all made sense.

And in designing my system, he made a couple of tweaks to the design which got me a higher efficiency rating and qualified me not only for a rebate from the electric company, but a $600 credit on my taxes next spring! Installation was fast and perfect. Very responsive customer service and quality technicians. I highly recommend them.; I just wanted to share my recent experience with Pipe Works Services Inc. I have to say, they were absolutely amazing. When I called their office, they were incredibly friendly and accommodating. They set up an inspection for me right away, on the same day!

They sent a supervisor named Mike, who arrived promptly and explained everything to me in great detail. I was very impressed by his knowledge and professionalism. The very next day, they called me to schedule a service. A few days later, supervisor Johnny Dorieux and his crew showed up and wow, they were hard workers!

I was faced with a terrible clogged toilet, and I was almost convinced that an extensive task would be needed to get to and clear the pipes.

This enabled him to effectively remove the blockage without the necessity to disturb the Sheetrock and directly reach the pipes. The entire job was finished in under an hour, and it was remarkably less expensive than what another plumber might have demanded for comprehensive pipe work. I wholeheartedly recommend them!; The plumbing work was completed promptly and precisely, complemented by outstanding customer service. The plumbers, namely Jaden, Bennett, and Colby, were knowledgeable and took the time to answer all queries patiently.

All interactions, including those with the customer service representatives, have been pleasant.

Thanks to Bennett, we're ecstatic to finally have hot water in our New York home!","bennett was the kindest and most sociable plumber we've ever employed. not only did he repair the pipe leak beneath our new york home, even in the dark, but he also possessed a fantastic attitude. he had plenty of positive things to say about the plumbing company he's associated with. he's straightforward and didn't shy away from expressing his contentment with his company.; The plumbing work was completed promptly and precisely, complemented by outstanding customer service. The plumbers, namely Jaden, Bennett, and Colby, were knowledgeable and took the time to answer all queries patiently. I've had the pleasure of interacting with these three different plumbers since I started using their services last year in New York. All interactions, including those with the customer service representatives, have been pleasant. I would recommend this plumbing service for any plumbing requirement.; A courteous gentleman named Bennett, #3098, arrived to initially deal with our water heater, but he went above and beyond by advising me that the entire system should be replaced for safety reasons. Having two young children, his honesty was greatly appreciated, as some might have just carried out the given task without considering additional safety measures. Bennett was professional, informative, and respectful. He's a fantastic plumber and an excellent representative for the business. His work in New York was overall remarkable.; I'm excited to share another fantastic experience with Wilson Brothers Plumbing & Water Heaters. I was faced with a terrible clogged toilet, and I was almost convinced that an extensive task would be needed to get to and clear the pipes. The same day I reached out, Bennett, the head of the company, showed up with a brand new machine in which he had made a significant investment. This enabled him to effectively remove the blockage without the necessity to disturb the Sheetrock and directly reach the pipes. The entire job was finished in under an hour, and it was remarkably less expensive than what another plumber might have demanded for comprehensive pipe work. I wholeheartedly recommend them!; Bennett showcased his expertise and professionalism impressively. I'd previously had a few other plumbers visit, but Bennett was the only one who accurately identified the problem and came up with an economical solution. We're fortunate to have stumbled upon Bennett! He is a valuable asset to his company, which is now under new management, providing excellent service.

He was on time, professional, and clearly knowledgeable. He not only completed the installation efficiently but also took the time to explain the process and answer all my questions. Joe went above and beyond by giving me helpful preventative maintenance tips to keep the new heater running smoothly. I highly recommend Joe for any plumbing needs—he’s reliable, skilled, and genuinely cares about his customers.; I have used DWV twice now. Both times they did an excellent and fast job.

The first time I called them was on a Sunday because the sewer line going to the street was clogged. They had a plumber at my house in an hour and was able to snake out the unclog the sewer line pipe in 30 minutes.

The second time my tub drain deteriorated because of rotting pipes that caused a leak. After opening up the wall I noticed the line was pitched wrong. Once Joe got here and noticed the same thing. A small leak became a small renovation job. Joe helped me out to get everything corrected and repaired.; Joey and his team did a fantastic job responding to an emergency leak situation at our house.  He was very professional in communicating and completing the repairs in a very timely manner.  Highly recommended!; Our gas water heater suddenly started leaking water from the bottom of the tank (only 7 years old) last Saturday evening.  We immediately called HomeServe USA to the home we have a paid repair subscription service on.  After being put on hold for a long time, we were told the soonest appointment would be on a Monday just for the tech to examine the broken water heater and replacement options would be presented to us after the appointment (100% out of pocket).

They asked if we could turn off the gas and water valve with no instructions or simply “find” a local plumber to instruct us on how to do so.  I found this kind of “lack of instruction” instruction unacceptable.  We realized at that moment that we MUST seek other plumbing professionals’ help in getting the gas and water valve shut off immediately and contact the water heater company (still under warranty) the following day.

Fortunately, we were able to contact Joe with DWV SOLUTIONS and Joe was able to walk us through how to shut off the gas as well as water until service on Monday morning.  Since we were able to obtain an approved authorization code for a new water heater on Sunday, Joe was able to arrange for a new water heater first thing on Monday morning to begin the immediate replacement process.  By Monday afternoon, we resumed having hot water!!!

We are truly grateful for the speedy and knowledgeable service Joe provided.  I would HIGHLY recommend Joe/DWV SOLUTIONS to anyone in need of plumbing help!; I work at a showroom in midtown Manhattan.

I had called them because I needed a second opinion since I did not believe they couldn’t figure it out. The other company was able to find the diagnosis, which was that the thermostat needed to be changed out. The thermostat leaked battery acid on the back of it, and was intermittently not turning on the end switch on the zone valve head which activates the boiler to turn on.

I had reached out to Big Apple asking for a refund since again they were not able to assist me with the problem and they had told me no because I did not contact them when the issue had happened again with the thermostat.

They were slow and reluctant to follow up and repair the damage caused by their mistake. Ultimately it took 5 months of nagging them in order for them to follow up and complete the work. It was a really bad experience overall.; Looking to revise this to 5 stars later this year when I use them again or finish the current job. Overall no complaints. Paul S. is prompt with replies. Not a huge operation, but I cherrish the interaction a lot. Paul C. is very honest with providing expert assessment on proposed work for the next job, so I am confident they will work for their customers well. This is in Brooklyn, so hopefully more consistent than those reviews from Manhattan.; Called them on Friday and they came first thing Monday to repair a Leaky pipe at Steam Radiator connection. Owner and scheduler were always in good communication! As a home owner its great to deal with a tech that responds quickly and shows up when he says. Eldi did a good job in just a few hours. Thanks! Will give them a call next time!; They came to our apartment in downtown Manhattan at the height of COVID when our boiler stopped working and they did an excellent job fixing it. They wore face-masks and booties on their shoes the entire time and were courteous and professional. The work required cleaning the boiler, installing a fair amount of new piping, and ordering and installing a new part, all of which they handled quickly and efficiently.

As I am on my way Joe calls me and says the technicians are waiting and if I’m not there in 10 minutes they have to leave. Knew if I started doing business with them it would not end well. It’s a shame considering this company was recommended by Balkan sewer and main in Jamaica; called Kew Gardens and they scheduled me with a repair appointment.
John was our technician that came out to fix our central air unit. He called me ahead of time when he was on his way to my home and he was right on time for the appointment. On the phone and throughout the service appointment in my home, George was very nice and he was extremely professional.
Our central air unit needed a new motor. George did not have a motor for our unit on his truck. He called his office and a new replacement motor was delivered to our house quickly while George tended to other aspects of our repair. George was very thorough and clean during the work that he was performing on our unit. He was able to get our central air unit efficiently in a timely fashion.
When George was finished with the repair, he checked over all of my central air unit’s systems and when he was done he left leaving my home clean and in order as if he had never been in my home and making a repair.
Kew Gardens installed my heater and my central air unit eight years ago. I keep up my service agreements on both of these units annually with Kew Gardens. They have come through for me and my family more times than I can count for scheduled maintenance and repairs. I have always been more than impressed with the professionalism, expertise, efficiency, and the cleanliness of every Kew Gardens technician that has ever been in my home and George was no different.
Thanks again to Kew Gardens and more importantly to George for saving the day!!!!!; Called up this company to report ""boiler not turning on issue"".

Called up another true licensed company, replaced thermocouple and bam! Boiler started working again. Time to get BBB engaged. This company needs to review their technician's license LOL.; Field manager name Mohamed came and said will come back next day to fix the problem and he never showed up and He took our 250 dollars.

Mike was professional and highly recommend him!; Judging by the reviews it’s a good thing I canceled, called for an appointment through Wendy between 12-4, Joe called me a while after saying they wanted to come earlier to give the technicians more time, it’s a business and we open at 10 so I told him 10:30, the technicians call me at 8:56 in the morning to tell me they are close by and I told them the prior agreement of 10:30 but I told them I can be there by 10. As I am on my way Joe calls me and says the technicians are waiting and if I’m not there in 10 minutes they have to leave. Knew if I started doing business with them it would not end well. It’s a shame considering this company was recommended by Balkan sewer and main in Jamaica; Called up this company to report ""boiler not turning on issue"". Technician name Ahmed and another Spanish technician came through to checkout boiler with no tools to check voltage, etc. These technicians left with taking $250, blaming on an electrical issue (despite having power throughout home and the wirings), without resolving the actual issue- boiler not turning on. Called up another true licensed company, replaced thermocouple and bam! Boiler started working again. Time to get BBB engaged. This company needs to review their technician's license LOL.; Field manager name Mohamed came and said will come back next day to fix the problem and he never showed up and He took our 250 dollars.
We called three to four times and they would hang up on us and would lie saying that they will come to fix the igniter. Which never happened.  I don’t recommend this place at all. Very dishonest.; called Kew Gardens and they scheduled me with a repair appointment.
John was our technician that came out to fix our central air unit. He called me ahead of time when he was on his way to my home and he was right on time for the appointment. On the phone and throughout the service appointment in my home, George was very nice and he was extremely professional.
Our central air unit needed a new motor. George did not have a motor for our unit on his truck. He called his office and a new replacement motor was delivered to our house quickly while George tended to other aspects of our repair. George was very thorough and clean during the work that he was performing on our unit. He was able to get our central air unit efficiently in a timely fashion.
When George was finished with the repair, he checked over all of my central air unit’s systems and when he was done he left leaving my home clean and in order as if he had never been in my home and making a repair.
Kew Gardens installed my heater and my central air unit eight years ago. I keep up my service agreements on both of these units annually with Kew Gardens. They have come through for me and my family more times than I can count for scheduled maintenance and repairs. I have always been more than impressed with the professionalism, expertise, efficiency, and the cleanliness of every Kew Gardens technician that has ever been in my home and George was no different.
Thanks again to Kew Gardens and more importantly to George for saving the day!!!!!"

Andrew took the time to thoroughly assess the problem and explained everything in clear, understandable terms. I appreciated his transparency and the fact that he took the time to provide a detailed estimate before starting any work. Additionally, I would like to add that their services are very reasonably priced.

The quality of the work was top-notch. The plumbers worked efficiently and diligently, ensuring that the job was done right.  They also left the workspace clean and tidy, which I greatly appreciated. The repair has held up perfectly, and I am confident in the durability of their work.

What truly sets N.J. McCann Plumbing & Heating
apart is their commitment to customer satisfaction. Andrew took the time out and followed up with a courtesy call a few days after the service to ensure everything was functioning properly and to address any lingering questions I might have had. This level of care and attention to detail is rare and greatly valued.

Overall, I highly recommend N.J. McCann Plumbing & Heating
to anyone in need of plumbing services. Their combination of excellent customer service, skilled workmanship, and genuine care for their clients makes them the best choice. I will undoubtedly turn to them for any future plumbing needs and will enthusiastically recommend them to friends and family. I am so happy to support a local family owned small business.

Thank you, N.J. McCann Plumbing & Heating for your outstanding service!!!!; Came yo fix my toilet early 09/2023.
Paid $200 and they will order part and return to fix. Two weeks past and no one calls or returns.
I call and told nothing in system, they ask for toilet model. Will order. A month later they return with wrong part and damage my sink faucet.

My hot water heater had to be replaced but it was still under warranty and Chris took the initiative to help me try to get a refund. He also had the new water heater installed quickly. N j McCann Plumbing is veteran friendly, fair to the elderly folks and I would highly recommend them. My other advice is stay away from apps the promise good service, stick with the local businesses.; We had a new water heater and new gas boiler installed converting from oil.  Andrew and his crew were great on all fronts.  He went over our options, made recommendations and made sure we would be happy with what we chose.  The job was completed in one day which was great.  I expected two.  They were neat, very friendly and professional.  The end result was fantastic.  He followed up a few days later to make certain the water and heat were working to our satisfaction.  We are ecstatic with the job.
Andrew originally replaced a gas boiler for our daughter which was also done with great care.  That is why we hired him again for our house.

3-	The person who arrived was unable to provide an estimate until the cost of the part(s) was determined.

I waited two days and reached back out and received a text with a rough $ estimate of 1 of the 3 things we needed. I followed up via text asking what the estimate was for the remaining items. Never heard back. Terrible communication. No respect for the customer’s time. Very disappointed after seeing the great reviews.

Step by step not only did he complete the task in it's entirety correctly but in the midst of doing so he was also explaining to me exactly what he was doing and what the purpose of it was. I'm extremely glad I called this company for help and even more so that it was Omar who they sent to my property. I'll certainly be employing their services again for all my properties going forward!; Omar and crew showed up on time and tried their best to track down a leak that we couldn’t seem to replicated the day after it happened. They stuck around for hours trying to find the issue and even though the leak hasn’t presented itself again (knock on wood) they assured us that they’d be back as soon as it happens again. They’re very honest and approachable. I would definitely bring them back for future projects.; Omar went above and beyond to provide us with excellent, honest service. We called a few companies that told us we needed a new furnace, but Omar diagnosed the problem, installed a new part, and got the heat up and running the same day. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and happy to answer all of my questions. Highly recommend! Omar is trustworthy and passionate about customer service.; They don’t care about your time. I had called the company and was told that someone would call me back later that day to schedule time to take a look at the scope of work. After not hearing back, I called again the next day and was told to text them the pictures and what we needed. They scheduled me for a Saturday between 10AM and 12PM. After not hearing from them around 12PM, I reached out and was told that they were stuck at another job and that Monday would be a better day, which is understandable. I waited until midday Monday (after clearing my schedule again to accommodate the visit) and reached out for an update. Was told that Tuesday was better. On Tuesday, a technician did come out and understood quite well what the various items we needed addressed were and told me I’d have an estimate soon. I waited two days and reached back out and received a text with a rough $ estimate of 1 of the 3 things we needed. I followed up via text asking what the estimate was for the remaining items. Never heard back. Terrible communication. No respect for the customer’s time. Very disappointed after seeing the great reviews. It would have been totally OK if I was just told from day one that the company was busy or was uninterested in my job. Instead I got strung along and wasted valuable time.; My heater had not worked for two or three weeks. The maintenance organization I called disregarded my calls for services twice! I chose to discover another company on Google and saw Super Plumbers Heating and Air Conditioning. I called a short while after 7:00 a.m., They replied and said they would be here quickly. They kept their promise and analyzed the issue in no time! The technician was cordial and expert while working rapidly and productively!

Five stars and that's only the tip of the iceberg, on the off chance that I could give them, for this professional job!"

We called National among others.  They quickly sent John to assess the job so that they could generate a quote.  The quote was less than we expected and coupled with the professionalism of John, we looked no further.

They quickly completed the job easily within our timetable and their plumber (John again) not only did the work but also checked and adjusted the water levels etc in the boiler. at no additional charge.

They quickly completed the job easily within our timetable and their plumber (John again) not only did the work but also checked and adjusted the water levels etc in the boiler. at no additional charge.

National went the extra mile and did a fast and great job.

We would highly recommend them.; I've worked with this company over the years and decided to leave a review.   I have had many positive experiences even as recent as a week ago.  Always a pleasure working with people that show initiative and actually do what they say.  Recently we hired National to install Gas Piping and provide a pressure test as well.  They were competitive on pricing and scheduled and met with the inspector.  Piping work looks great and the inspector was complimenting the work and professionalism.   Great company with great people.; This plumbing company is great, they came in and did some work in my house. They were fast and responsive. They communicated very well. I am satisfied with the quality of their work and the price was fair. I highly recommend National Plumbing and Heating."

To top it all off, his rates were reasonable so if my drains are ever clogged again, Ivar will be my first and only call.
I had called several other plumbers and drain cleaning services, such as the incompetents at Roto-Rooter who just gave a steaming pile of excuses about why my drain couldn't be clear and they left an invoice for the outrageous cost of $478.00"

They asked for $15k with an estimate of 6 hours of work. I asked them - let's say even you overcharged me for the parts, then your hour of work is still $2,000 per hour? They said - yes, that's the price. I understand the cost of bureaucracy in NYC adds to the bottom line. But they also asked for the double amount with less guarantees.; It was good service yesterday, repaired my boiler and water heater isuues and got heat back on.; On November 6th, 2022, we asked for a plumber through Neo to address a leaking toilet. I believe we were dealing with Neha who was working the dispatch and a Spanish speaking person who did not speak English at all. Neha had to translate and we had many phone calls throughout the repair to understand what was going on due to the lack of an English speaking plumber making it a very cumbersome and inefficient process.

Although they fixed my leaking toilet by replacing a wax ring, they charged me over $700 for it and they damaged my bathroom floor tile in front of the toilet. The plumber was careless and dragged the toilet forward damaging my floor. When I complained about it and sent pictures of the damaged floor there was no accountability. As a matter of fact, the plumber denied that he damaged the floor and Neha was gas lighting me that it's common for this to happen to floors when replacing a wax ring for a toilet and that I was trying to cheat them by asking for a discount. To replace my floor will cost me about $2,000.

If it's so common to damage floors when replacing a wax ring for a toilet, they should at least inform me about that possibility before doing the work. I could have made an informed decision whether to take the risk and proceed. Or, I could have put down some old towels to protect my floor. There was no such communication.

When things took unexpectedly longer, and when there was a leak after the job was done, they stood by their work and got the job done without any additional cost. All in all I paid just over $300 for labor ($200/hr), parts (~$75), and tax at the time of my job. They also didn't collect any money before the job was DONE. You NEVER see that these days with service providers.

Other companies overcharged or asked for money just to come check the job site out, usually on the order of $100-$300. Just to see the job.

Despite not having initial plans and facing the complexities of our classic and aged property, they skillfully navigated their ways and replaced hundreds of pipes and piping components over several months, achieving a near-miraculous restoration involving three floors.

HUB has worked in our property for years. Their support and expertise throughout this recent ordeal however were invaluable and deeply appreciated.

We were required to know everything about each project and Jason was very understanding and empathetic. He took his time many times long hours in explaining the highly technical language of changing gas pipes and all that the task involves to us and our engineer patiently, professionally and generously.

Rich is another gentleman who you can trust his expertise and his words.

They then told me I needed to steam clean the sewer main ($2000). I had 2 other local companies quote it for $850 and $900.

Not only are they bad at their job but they tried to con us into paying more than double the going rate for a service we didn’t really need.

I called them and Mike was out within an hour to fix a leak under my kitchen sink.
Talk about quick! It was a bad leak so I was very happy they came over fast.

They replaced all the necessary piping and  now no more leaks! Professional service all the way. Would recommend to anyone looking for a plumber around Greenpoint!
Thanks again!; Absolutely dreadful service. I hired these guys to repair a leak due to AC malfunction in my rental unit. On more than one occasion, the plumber (Patrick) was late and completely MIA after scheduling the visit. He was also extremely rude to my tenant. Zero professionalism. And it turned out that he is utterly incompetent and actually exacerbated the problem rather than fixing it. As a result, I got a bigger leak, more damage, and $1600 less in my bank account. I then hired an independent HVAC technician to assess the new issue, and he confirmed that it was caused by the recent careless repairs. As a result of Patrick's poor workmanship and gross negligence, part of the ceiling eventually collapsed on my tenant due to excessive water damage. When I informed Patrick of these findings and requested a refund, he rudely refused. (Ironically, the work contract said ""We guarantee 100% satisfaction or your money back""). I strongly suggest you avoid doing business with this scumbag at all costs.; Mike showed up one day late, as well as tried to charge $680! for a simple jewelry retrieval job that took 5min, after an initial quote for $75 which somehow turned into $380 when he and team entered the door (expected 🙄)… but $680!

Long story short we begrudgingly settled for $460 at the end of the day. These price gouging plumbers left me feeling like my perception of reality was flooded…

Needless to say won’t be calling them again; I noticed a worrying leak under my kitchen sink. Concerned about potential water damage, I contacted Greenpoint Plumbing renowned for their expertise and prompt response from my past experiences with them. The appointment was scheduled efficiently, with a clear timeframe given.

Their plumber Mike arrived right on time, impressively equipped with all the necessary tools and parts. He was professional, courteous, and took the time to explain the issue – a worn-out pipe joint – and how he planned to fix it. I appreciated his transparency and the way he communicated complex plumbing details in an easy-to-understand manner.

The repair process was seamless. He meticulously replaced the faulty part, ensuring everything was properly sealed and tested for leaks. What really stood out was his attention to detail; he even adjusted the under-sink piping to prevent future issues, a proactive step that demonstrated his thorough expertise.

Moreover, the service was surprisingly affordable. I had braced myself for a hefty bill, given the urgency and quality of the work, but the cost was very reasonable. They even offered a warranty on the repair, reassuring me of the value and reliability of their work.

I was thoroughly pleased with the entire experience. The quick resolution, expert repair, and excellent customer service left me feeling extremely satisfied. It's encounters like these that reinforce the importance of choosing skilled professionals for home plumbing needs.; I recently faced a nightmare regarding my home's main sewer line in Brooklyn, and the experience was no less than frustrating. A clogged main drain is not something one can ignore, and I was no exception. I tried several home remedies, but none of them worked, so I decided to seek professional help.

The good news is that I opted for a hydro jet treatment that turned out to be a game-changer. Their plumber Gary and Charlie showed up on time and were very professional. They examined the stubborn blockage with a specialized camera and then used the high-pressure jet to blast through the obstruction with ease. The interesting thing is that the hydro jetting technique was more environmentally friendly than other conventional drain cleaning methods and took way less time to complete.

After finishing the job, they wrapped everything up by conducting a camera inspection to ensure the locks had been removed, and everything was flowing smoothly, and they did a great job cleaning up the site. The whole service was conducted in a highly professional manner, and I was happy with the outcome.

Considering the exceptional service I received, I would highly recommend the hydro jetting method for anyone facing issues with a clogged main drain. Its effectiveness, safety, and efficiency make it the perfect solution for such a problem. It is a fantastic way to clean your drains thoroughly and bring them back to normal, free-flowing conditions. I am grateful for the job well done and can confidently say that they have gained a new loyal customer.","Greenpoint plumbing was excellent!

Check the before and after pics below:; Please steer clear of this service.  They definitely will appear at your door for service, however, once there the technician will perform NOTHING and the boss of the company will immediately charge you an incredible amount of money to clear a stoppage.
The technician arrived at my location to clear a sink stoppage.  This is where the story gets good.  The technician had to contact his boss several times for approval to utilize different snaking machines of which, varied charges applies, basically a dog and pony show.
The first estimate to clear my stoppage was, $875.00 which I immediately denied as I was not installing a new faucet and sink. and assoicated piping. Then the technician ran a 30 foot snake at a negotiated price, then required to utilize a 50 foot snake at a different price.
All said and done the technician was NOT able to clear anything from the pipes and after a great deal of negotition the price was finalized at, $250.00 (ridiculous) and over (2) hours of my time shadowing this sketchy service.
The next day I called another plumber to my house and cleared my stoppage in less then 30 minutes for less then $200.00
This company is inexperienced, very expensive, unpredictable service and rude in attempt to steal money from me with an intial quote of $875!!!
Steer clear and DO NOT CALL this company, unless you want to be totally taken advantage of in your home.; Worked with Hector of Emergency Plumbing Service - who was super professional, efficient, and knowledgable. He really cares about doing a good job and from start to finish - made me feel like a valued customer (That is so rare these days).

He came over immediately to remove my leaky 55+ year old radiators that were ruining my floors (the valves had actually melted on the gauge - making their removal not so easy). But Hector figured out a way to remove them without damaging the intake valve. Then, on his own, he got me a fantastic deal on 2 brand new radiators that he installed ASAP.

I have to say, Hector really does take pride in his work and he wouldn’t leave until he was 100% sure both new radiators 100% worked and were 100% leak-free (which they were).

Great price, great work ethic, and extremely professional. What more could you ask for? My wife and I were so impressed we‘re actually gonna work with Hector in the future to have him and his company renovate our bathroom!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! AAAAA++++++ all the way!; So happy we found them! They said they would come within an hour, and they did deliver within an hour. They did the job in a professional manner, they were very knowledgeable, and the price was absolutely unbelievably fair and reasonable. We will definitely be using them again.
Fran V.; Hektor showed up within 30 minutes of us calling his business and repaired our boiler, patiently explaining what the issues were. He was not only prompt but professional and did an amazing job. Highly recommend!","Please steer clear of this service.

They steal time by leaving for parts despite a parts house being literally 1 block away. The so-called plumbers have literally no experience. In fact, a second plumber had to reset a toilet because it was done improperly… so why did I have to pay for these hours and materials if your plumbers can’t do the job right the first time?  Run from this company. They also want you to sign their forms without any job info on them. Do not call them. You will be sorry you did. They are thieves.; What a waste of time.  They came to give me an estimate to replace radiators.  Mumbled a lot about “seeing what’s available” and promised to get back to me.  Didn’t get back to me.  When I followed up, the response was totally incoherent.  If the job was too small for them (as I suspect), they should have said that.; Horrible experience from this company.

We had to called back to discuss a faint smell in one of the toilets after the installation was done by Adriatic. We started noticing the smell after a couple of months.

But the person at desk jumped at the very beginning to assure me that this is not a callback and that they’d take no responsibility.

I would understand if they had suggested to take a look and charge me if it wasn’t their mistake.

But this wasn’t a very professional company and they wasted our time and money. Definitely won’t recommend their services to anyone.; I used them because my co-op's super used them for a building issue.  I now worry about the building issue, but hopefully the super knows enough about plumbing and kept a close eye on them.

I regrettably used them twice.  The first time they sent me an incompetent or unqualified plumber to fix a shower faucet cartridge.  When he couldn't do it, they sent me another incompetent plumber who also failed.  They finally sent me a ""specialist"" who was qualified enough to actually change the cartridge.  Not exactly rocket science.  To make matters worse, I didn't realize at first but they charged me for all three of these visits.  A few months later I have a small problem with my kitchen faucet.  They guy they sent showed up late, told me I should order a replacement part and have him come back to install it.  I'm not a plumber, I don't know where to get parts and many part distributors won't bother to call back random people.  After he left and I disassembled the part myself, reseated a gasket and fixed the problem.   I was most surprised to get a call the next day with a bill for $300 for a 5 minute visit from some guy who was late and then did nothing.

In short, they are staffed with incompetent, unqualified or lazy plumbers, they are unprofessional and show up late without calling, they overbill, and they don't stand behind their work.; I hardly ever write reviews but Adriatic distinguished themselves as so bad that people need to know.

Firstly. They sent an unlicensed apprentice to do the work. Im not sure if that's uncommon, but, of course, the guy, who could have started plumbing the day before, should have had his work inspected by a licensed plumber he was working under.

That never happened. I'm almost positive that's illegal.

I had a number of severe plumbing problems due to their incompetance.

Firstly, I live in an apartment so all the pipes are connected. They never sealed off their work in the bathroom with a valve under my kitchen sink.

When my handyman noticed during a routine job, he had to call an emergency shutdown of my building's plumbing.

Apparently, the unsealed valve could have flooded and destroyed my apartment and possessions.

This was a strictly amateur mistake that no one else would have made. Indeed my handyman is not a plumber and he noticed immediately.

Secondly, the apprentice told me how lousy my previous were pipes behind the  shower walls. He did some elaborate job and since then my water pressure has been awful.

I can make it tolerable by fidgeting with the valve that switches the water from the tub faucet to the shower. But I have to fidget endlessly while freezing because when it switches to tub I'm standing in the cold in my birthday suit.

Lastly, the elaborate pipe  malfunctioning masterpiece made their work go over $1500 over their estimated price.

Incompetance costs in so many ways. Buyer beware.","What a waste of time.  They came to give me an estimate to replace radiators.

ChIJo36eI1tfwokRpLFLDFhBl-w,Liquid Tech Plumbing & Heating Inc.,"76-22 30th Ave., East Elmhurst, NY 11370",5,37,,N/A,"What started as a fairly simple gas pipe replacement at the beginning of August (to replace a previously unshielded gas pipe that had eroded inside the concrete stoop wall) turned into a 3-month journey that required not only the gaps pipes to be replaced, but also all of the white PVC HVAC pipes through the 6 floors of our Brownstone house in Harlem , that were absolutely fine when the house was renovated 14 years ago but, since 2022, have been superseded by the grey PVC-C pipes now mandated by the DoB.
So what should have been 3-4 weeks to replace the corroded gas pipe and get our gas and hot water back on, took 3 months and a lot of extra work, heartache and $$ that we had not expected.
Paul and his team at Liquid Tech were absolutely superb, and I’d hire them again in a heartbeat (but hope I don’t have to).  They were totally professional, helpful, informative and calm - even when I was freaking out during DoB inspections finding out we had WAY more work to do and would cost us lost rental income plus added structural costs.
We just had gas restored to our upstairs rental unit this week and I was so so happy that Paul and his team got us through the finish line in one piece, in time for the winter weather. And boy was that first hot shower fantastic!
Highly Recommended!!!!; I have been a landlord of 3 properties for most demanding tenants who are mostly Ivy League students. My gas line was cut off by Con Ed. I tried 4 plumbing companies. They all failed me. They asked for exorbitant sum of money and also wasted my time. Then Paul came and saved my business. He and his crew at Liquid Tech did the job under record time and for thousands of dollars cheaper.
Paul is the best that America has to offer. I would recommend him as the very best. Thanks again Liquid Tech.; I highly recommend Paul and his team for gas work. Paul is very responsive over text messaging and easy to communicate with. Compared to other quotes he was on the mid-higher end but he clearly cares about high workmanship and does not cut corners, which is difficult to find lately. The job ended up being more complicated than anticipated but he was very fair with the final cost.; I recently hired Paul Huckemeyer from Liquid Tech Plumbing & Heating to get a new gas stove authorized for gas service, which to my surprise required DOB permits and authorization. Not only was his fee quote the best price, he was also very responsive, answered my questions, reassured me of the process and kept me up to date. He deliver as promised, on time and on price, and  greatly reduced my stress level.  I would use him again in a heartbeat.; I am so happy with the service provided by Liquid Tech Plumbing and Heating. Paul was able to provide me with a logical plan and a realistic estimate for both my boiler repair and re-establishment of my gas service. His communication was clear and reassuring. He completed all work expeditiously, on time and on budget. When there was a field condition that required a shift in the scope of work, he was able to pivot seamlessly without interruption. I am grateful for his integrity and professionalism. I recommend Liquid Tech without any reservation. Thank you, Paul!","What started as a fairly simple gas pipe replacement at the beginning of August (to replace a previously unshielded gas pipe that had eroded inside the concrete stoop wall) turned into a 3-month journey that required not only the gaps pipes to be replaced, but also all of the white PVC HVAC pipes through the 6 floors of our Brownstone house in Harlem , that were absolutely fine when the house was renovated 14 years ago but, since 2022, have been superseded by the grey PVC-C pipes now mandated by the DoB.
So what should have been 3-4 weeks to replace the corroded gas pipe and get our gas and hot water back on, took 3 months and a lot of extra work, heartache and $$ that we had not expected.
Paul and his team at Liquid Tech were absolutely superb, and I’d hire them again in a heartbeat (but hope I don’t have to).  They were totally professional, helpful, informative and calm - even when I was freaking out during DoB inspections finding out we had WAY more work to do and would cost us lost rental income plus added structural costs.
We just had gas restored to our upstairs rental unit this week and I was so so happy that Paul and his team got us through the finish line in one piece, in time for the winter weather. And boy was that first hot shower fantastic!
Highly Recommended!!!!; I highly recommend Paul and his team for gas work. Paul is very responsive over text messaging and easy to communicate with. Compared to other quotes he was on the mid-higher end but he clearly cares about high workmanship and does not cut corners, which is difficult to find lately. The job ended up being more complicated than anticipated but he was very fair with the final cost.; I recently hired Paul Huckemeyer from Liquid Tech Plumbing & Heating to get a new gas stove authorized for gas service, which to my surprise required DOB permits and authorization. Not only was his fee quote the best price, he was also very responsive, answered my questions, reassured me of the process and kept me up to date. He deliver as promised, on time and on price, and  greatly reduced my stress level.

I am grateful for his integrity and professionalism. I recommend Liquid Tech without any reservation. Thank you, Paul!; I have been a landlord of 3 properties for most demanding tenants who are mostly Ivy League students. My gas line was cut off by Con Ed. I tried 4 plumbing companies. They all failed me. They asked for exorbitant sum of money and also wasted my time. Then Paul came and saved my business. He and his crew at Liquid Tech did the job under record time and for thousands of dollars cheaper.
Paul is the best that America has to offer. I would recommend him as the very best. Thanks again Liquid Tech."
ChIJubnchdBewokRh-lVsPqN90Q,Sunnyside Heating and Plumbing,"40-11 Greenpoint Ave, Sunnyside, NY 11104",4.4,13,,N/A,"My water heater broke and I was stressing out how much it was going to cost to fix it. I called around to a couple of places and was being quoted crazy $$$. I got lucky with Mike. He checked it out and gave me the best price possible and really took care of everything. Not only did he have the BEST PRICE, he wasn’t rude like the other guys. Thank you Mike! You’re my new go to guy! The work was quick, easy and seamless.; I don't generally do reviews. This business deserves a truly awful one. Stay well clear -- you have been warned! Details here:

I had an older boiler failing to ignite. I needed it diagnosed and repaired and I called Sunnyside Heating. They told me it would be $85 to have someone come out, and I agreed. I sent them a copy of the boiler manual and a screenshot of the troubleshooting page that said the error was likely to be because of flame rods or gas valve. Once two techs arrived (why 2?) and tried to ignite it (same as I did), they said it would cost $375 additional to actually open the boiler and look. I thought that was pretty outrageous seeing they had told me 85 for the assessment, but we had no heat or hot water and I needed to find out whether it was repairable or not. I asked the techs if the money would be credited toward the repair. They said yes toward the repair, but not towards any parts needed. It sounded reasonable, though I didn't like that they had not been upfront about the real cost of assessment, so I went ahead despite misgivings that should have stopped me cold. Cost incurred: $460

Next I wait for information about whether the part is available. I wait more than a day and a half to hear back and am told they are still waiting to hear from their guys. I make a single phone call to an internet heating parts supplier and learn that there is an identical replacement for the obsolete original part. I check with Mike at Sunnyside that they can work with it and he says yes. I order the part ($200) and receive it two days later. I tell Mike and arrange to have a tech come the next day. To his/their credit, he arranges for a tech to come right away.

But when the same two techs come, check that the part is an exact replacement and relay that information to Mike, they tell me the replacement will cost -- wait for it -- $1275. No mention of any credit from the former payment. No mention of this additional labor(??) charge was ever made at any point previously, despite my having asked the techs on their first visit what the repair was likely to cost. If they had told me $1935 was the full cost of the assessment and repair -- even if they had told me that the replacement itself was going to be $1275 (I asked the techs if they had a posted hourly rate and they, tellingly, said ""no"") -- I would have told them not to come back. As it was, I got on the phone to Mike and told them it was an outrageous quote and charge, and what about the previous credit. He was pretty quick to offer to credit that money toward the new $1275, for a total of $815. He seemed to feel that was generous. I told him I thought this was still outrageous and deceptive. I told him I would like to pay $375 for the replacement, which would have made a total of $835 paid to his company for maybe an hour of work altogether. That's still good money, even when you needlessly send 2 techs. But he was not willing to consider that price, so he called his techs back in.

I called another plumbing company (Above and Beyond) and got a firm quote for the work. $375.

If you have any questions about the level of professionalism and courtesy on display, please consider the attached text thread:; I have been a customer of theirs for several years and have always received excellent service. Recently, I had the need to call them three times in the span of a few weeks due to some urgent plumbing issues. Each time, their plumbers arrived quickly and with a great attitude. They efficiently fixed the problem and also took the time to provide me with some valuable tips on how to better take care of my plumbing system. I am very impressed with the level of customer service provided by them and will continue to use their services in the future. Highly recommend!; I've never been one to leave reviews, but I feel like this plumber really deserves one. Gary is an honest guy who works fast and has the know-how to get the job done right. I had a backed-up kitchen sink that he wasn't initially able to clear, but after gaining access through another access point, he was able to clear the blockage. I thought we were done, but no - this clearing caused the downstairs laundry room to get flooded because of the blockage getting moved. Gary didn't hesitate to remove the jury-rigged washing machine drain and snake the sewage line again until it was fixed. Like I said, good service from a pro!; This is a dispatch number to random plumbing non-licensed and non-insured subcontractors. I was in a bind with a leaking HW Tank and they did the work - demanded cash - but couldn't provide plumbing license or insurance and Company Name and address and warranty provided was bogus -  all 5 star ratings listed in reviews are also bogus -  STAY AWAY unless you want to be SCAMMED","My water heater broke and I was stressing out how much it was going to cost to fix it.

This was needed to be completed within 3 weeks of receipt.  I contacted JTG and their staff was extremely helpful and professional. The inspection and certificate filing was completed with time to spare.  I would highly recommend this company.; Gas meter room inspection is mandatory.  JTG was efficient, polite, neat, and reasonably priced.  They keep track of the codes and keep us in compliance.  I recommend them 100%.  Raphael Santore 19 Murray street management.; Has been great in the past and we've used them for multiple projects but I've called and emailed numerous times about a parapet inspection only to receive a ton of automated emails through ReDocs offering an appointment that doesn't work with my schedule and no way of rescheduling or speaking with a human. I emailed, used the chat function and I've called many times. Incredibly frustrating. I'm going with another company and won't be utilizing your services in the future."

They said they warranty everything they do and we decided to go with them. We went through the space that they have for install as we were doing a new basement and wanted to make sure it was kept to where we needit it. Also we were brought nest thermostats and wanted to use them. Andreas explained how he preferred Ecobee if we were going that route. So we exchanged the nest thermostats for the Ecobee .They installed the Navien boiler with Andreas and his guys doing the installation. It took them the day which wasn't bad and seemed great.
Andreas didn't install the thermostat and loaned us a thermostat (old school one. So he could come back and install the Ecobee because he didn't have enough time. He was going to comeback and finish the thermostats. The night got chilly and the new Navien was working but around midnight it shut off the heat with an era code. My Parents found t strange.  When we called Andreas he was heading to Italy for a trade show, according to him. We restarted the system and got the heat to start working . Then it stopped again. My parents are older and retired with little source of income and they had to deal with this problem. I called Andreas and asked him if he can send one of his guys to fix it and he said it would have to be him him when he comes back. He asked me to read him back the codes and then asked me to get a chair and see if I can reach the exhaust pipe and see if I could move it up. I did and you can hear the water running back to the boiler. It sounded like it shouldn't have been there. He said just lift it up and down Everytime the boiler shuts down.  It's water getting stuck in the exhaust. Which right there I knew the install was incorrect. Also there was a water lign which was supposed to be high in the ceiling that they left low that he had to come back and redo. I will cut the review short if not this thing will be very long on all the things that went wrong on the install.
Put it this way we called for service from him and never heard back.

- Was referred to call Maurice Burton, a local plumber, and I did early morning. He picked up, took my info and said he will call me back, which he did a few hrs later and to tell me he will visit for a quote.
- He came by shortly after and was a nice older fellow. He checked what I needed and inspected the set-up and we agreed on the quote, and he left and said will send someone.
- Kevin came by in the afternoon. Good kid and well trained. He worked on the pipes and finished. Unfortunately, I guess due to old house water pipes and pressure, have low water pressure from sink. He spent a good deal of time and tried to fix that and also removed all filters from the sink hose end, but still low pressure which I'm still dealing with today. Maybe it's the old pipes, or this model sink hose I need to investigate. I then paid quote in cash and as a note, also expect tax to be added on top. If credit card, they will add additional credit card fee which is common nowadays. As he left, I tested the sink, but noticed a very tiny drop of a leak when filling the sink with water and then letting it go down drain all at once. I called again and Maurice said he will send someone the next day.
- I didn't get a visit in the morning so called again and Anthony picked up and I texted him the video of the leak which looked like a slight adjustment just needs to be done. He was pleasant and said it would be a quick fix and will send someone.

I recently moved into my home and of course everything breaks down. From my initial Maintenance visit to today, I've come to trust Tidal Plumbing. Matt, Mark & Sonny are extremely knowledgeable, professional, reliable and customer oriented. Matt always takes the time to explain what needs to be done in layman's terms. This level of transparency allows me to fully comprehend and make the best decision. I have a new boiler which was purchased and installed by Tidal Plumbing. The kitchen faucet was leaking into the basement, which required pipes to be replaced & a new faucet. I also got my washer and dryer installed. I am very pleased with the work and pricing from Tidal Plumbing. They are my go to for all my Plumbing needs. I give them five stars, for their integrity to service the customer first.; Working with Tidal Plumbing has been a great experience.  They worked with me on a number of repairs needed around the house.  Communication, skill and professionalism were top notch.  I will use them again for any plumbing need.; Very good work and accountability throughout the entire project.  I gave them access to my home and they were very respectful and responsible. Matt, Sunny and Rameen thanks for the great work.; As soon as I was getting ready to go to the gym and all dressed up, Con Ed (contractor) started knocking on my door. They absolutely ruined my day because they decided to shut my gas off and discovered gas leaks and not making it to the gym. I was panicking like crazy, like what the heck was I going to do? I had all these plumbers coming giving me insane quotes. Tidal was the first plumbing company that gave me a reasonable price and honestly it was the right company to work with. Matt and Sunny are true professionals and they went out of the way to fix my issue last minute since you can only have a 5 day grace period for Con Ed to turn your gas on immediately. They are always on time when it comes to fixing last minute things, responsive, super professional to their customers and hard working for working late at night. They relieved a lot of my stress as well when it comes to the paper work. Amazing Plumbing company! A++++++++; Absolutely unbelievably terrific company, service and completed work.  I have contracted with several plumbing companies in the past for work on my 130 year old house and this company was excellent in setting expectations and then topping them.  Juan and Robin arrived within 20 minutes of the appointment time, asked permission to enter the home and were meticulous about entering and exiting the residence, i.e. letting me know each time one or the other were leaving to obtain supplies.  Both gentlemen were respectful to me and my home and left everything as if no one was even there (except the work was done!).  I never realized how important being comfortable during work was until I realized that in the past I was always anxious!.  Thank you Tidal and I will not be calling any other service in the future!","Very good work and accountability throughout the entire project.

ChIJx6r7IWdiwokR6RBPvHkfQ8g,Tri-County Plumbing,"260-09 Hillside Ave., Floral Park, NY 11004",2.9,16,,N/A,"I used this company a couple of times. Located in Floral park.They installed a toilet which was by the hour including the hour that the young man sit in his truck. They also fixed a link.
This time they charged me 197.25 for a consultation, I already knew what had to be fixed when they came. The young man talked to me on the phone because I wasn't home at the time.
I will pay it because I believe things always workout for me but I also feel this is a very steep price to just come and look at my linking faucet; Stay far away from Tricounty plumbing. They will rip you off, cause damage and then send you a bill to come back and fix an appliance that they already charged you to install and tell you it’s your fault not theirs. Their staff is inexperienced and you foot the bill as a result. If you try to speak to them about a concern, the owner, Frank, yells over you and ridicules you to try to make it seem like they are doing the right thing. Honestly, just go somewhere else. They also charge a labor rate that is supposed to be for 2 people that is really one person and an apprentice who stands around and isn’t able to help with anything. It’s insanity and they are literally just trying to make as much money as they can off of you. I have never felt taken advantage of by a plumber before, but I truly feel this way about Tricounty.; Tri County was initially hired in 2006 for a large project, including radiant heat, new bathroom, bar sink, washer and dryer. The work at the time, which is now 11 years ago, was $22,500. they were paid promptly. the contracted price included all permits. The radiant heat has always has always had issues, then come to find out they had cemented down the toilet to ground. instead of properly mounting with bolts. Along with the radiant heat pipes running so close to the toilet drain; his own plumber said was going to have to tare out the floor, re run the pipes to be able to mount the toilet to the floor properly.

Now fast forward 10 years, remember when they filed all those permits... they did not. The bar sink that was put in was never permitted. after spending hours with town and the court, the conclusion was I just needed my plumber to file the permit. I called Tri County back and spoke to Kathy, Frank, and John (john was the original plumber) John said they would file the permit. I called every week, 2-3 times a week with phone calls never returned, and them very well knowing we had a pending court date. Shame on them
I ended up getting another plumber to file the permit, but it cost me additional $900.

There are plenty of plumbers out there. poor workmanship, ripoff prices, and does not follow through on what they say they will do.; I was very loyal to Tri-Cty for many years...primarily because the owner was a neighbor and I liked him. Although he always gave me a very fair price, the work often had to be redone. Plus I wasn’t very impressed with who he sent to do the work. One guy spent most of the time on the phone trying to promote his music career as a rapper. The same guy inspected the sewer line or something with a camera and told me in no uncertain terms that a plumbing disaster was imminent and I needed to get this major work done. I said no. He told me I was making a huge mistake. Thankfully I ignored him. That was easily 12 years ago and it’s still fine. No disaster. When I gave him a HUGE job, I was let down in so many ways...in fact, if it was any other company I would have fired them early on. They had a helper who showed up reeking of pot. The plumber would show up late, take stock of what was needed, leave for a few hours, end the day early and leave a mess. (I can do on and on). Today, I noticed that the sink they installed a couple of years ago is now coming off the wall. I have NEVER seen that before, anywhere I've ever lived. Additionally, half the people on my block thought I was crazy to give Tri-Cty work. At least four neighbors used them once and never again. Sadly, I will never use them again or recommend them. The sink coming literally unglued was the final straw and prompted this post; This company deserves a negative star.. they were called to inspect a possible leak for the board and left with an assumption. They never confirmed any leak but charged a bill any way. The old lady answering phones is extremely unprofessional and needs to retire.","I used this company a couple of times.

At the time, we didn't have a go-to plumber, so we reached out to Potter Brothers Plumbing. On the same day we contacted them, Cameron was able to squeeze us into his hectic schedule. Since then, we've requested their services on multiple occasions. Cameron has expertly replaced the inner workings of 2 toilets, updated the shut-off valve for our modern dishwasher, and more recently installed a brand new utility sink. He also equipped our newly finished basement half-bath with a fresh sink and toilet. Cameron's plumbing skills are impressive, his work is efficient, and he is dependable. His rates are always reasonable and he's someone you can trust. If you're in need of a reliable plumber, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend Cameron. We know he's the one we'll be calling whenever we need plumbing services!; Our kitchen sink and washing machine were suffering from a blockage issue. I reached out to a plumbing company and was greeted by a very friendly receptionist who promptly arranged an appointment for us for the following day. Malachi gave me a call before his arrival and showed up right on time. Our clean out hadn't been accessed before and locating it required some digging. Malachi handled the task professionally and showed great expertise. He was also very considerate, ensuring he didn't bring any dirt into our house. The pricing was reasonable for the top-notch service they provided. I wouldn't hesitate to endorse this plumbing service to others.; I can't recommend this plumbing service enough!

It's truly a challenge to find a reliable, efficient, and high-quality plumbing service these days. We recently had a problem with our main pipes getting blocked up in Nutley. We tried everything, but nothing worked. Then we made a quick call and were connected with a knowledgeable specialist, like Cameron or Malachi, who came out and resolved our issue swiftly and without breaking the bank. We now know exactly who to call for all our plumbing needs in the future. I would definitely suggest giving them a try!; Our kitchen sink and washing machine were suffering from a blockage issue. I reached out to a plumbing company and was greeted by a very friendly receptionist who promptly arranged an appointment for us for the following day. Malachi gave me a call before his arrival and showed up right on time. Our clean out hadn't been accessed before and locating it required some digging. Malachi handled the task professionally and showed great expertise. He was also very considerate, ensuring he didn't bring any dirt into our house. The pricing was reasonable for the top-notch service they provided. I wouldn't hesitate to endorse this plumbing service to others.; Recently, after moving into a new condo, we found ourselves in need of some plumbing updates. At the time, we didn't have a go-to plumber, so we reached out to Potter Brothers Plumbing. On the same day we contacted them, Cameron was able to squeeze us into his hectic schedule. Since then, we've requested their services on multiple occasions. Cameron has expertly replaced the inner workings of 2 toilets, updated the shut-off valve for our modern dishwasher, and more recently installed a brand new utility sink. He also equipped our newly finished basement half-bath with a fresh sink and toilet. Cameron's plumbing skills are impressive, his work is efficient, and he is dependable. His rates are always reasonable and he's someone you can trust. If you're in need of a reliable plumber, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend Cameron. We know he's the one we'll be calling whenever we need plumbing services!; We had a wonderful experience with Cameron while he was working on our plumbing and thermostat in Nutley.

I reached out to Cronin for a quote to replace a combination boiler/water heater that came with my apartment when I purchased it.

Among all the companies I contacted, Cronin stood out by providing a sense of reassurance and exceptional care—crucial when making a significant investment!

During our initial call, their team took the time to thoroughly explain the entire process and work involved. They were exceptionally knowledgeable, covering everything from the pros and cons of different unit types to the mechanics of the installation and the necessary city permitting.

The quote provided was clear, easy to pay online and there were no surprise costs added at the end.

Cronin’s team efficiently removed the old unit and installed a Navien NCB-190/080H combination boiler/water heater in just two days. Once the installation was complete, they walked me through the unit's operation, cleaned the work area, and even vacuumed the hallway outside.

With their skilled, friendly, and top-quality craftsmen, I will definitely rely on them for future servicing and will be recommending them to friends and neighbors.; These guys did a great job of replacing our furnace for us!  They accommodated us quickly and did a great job of explaining all of our options while giving us a lot of useful information.  Whole team of workers were professional and made us feel like we were in good hands!  They are even coming next season for a complimentary preseason check up.; The five stars are well deserved! From start to finish, great communication (I talked to Nick), fair pricing and top-notch execution. I needed a new faucet installed and a kitchen drain replaced. Joe and Asiv (I'm sorry if I'm misspelling the name) were very professional and respectful of our apartment. My baby had also just fallen asleep when they arrived and she never woke up when they were doing the work :) I really appreciated the detailed estimate/quote, shoe covers(!!!) and being able to schedule the project via e-mail. I wholeheartedly recommend this business!; Pat, Josh, Nick and team are excellent to work with. This was our second time using them, and they’ve done emergency water heater replacement as well as regular appointments for RO system & recirculating pump installation and with great professionalism. They even went a step beyond a helped me plumb in my espresso machine that didn’t use US standard fittings. I appreciate their attention to customer satisfaction and the great communication throughout the project. Highly recommend.; Wow, what an incredibly knowledgeable and friendly team and service! From the initial phone inquiry through to a considered follow up note, the Cronin family was top notch. They provided expert guidance on the current stage of our plumbing infrastructure, made recommendations to ensure longevity and efficiency, and fixed some immediate issues flawlessly.","These guys did a great job of replacing our furnace for us!

Let's just say there was water leaking from about 4 places.  I tried our usual plumber and was annoyed after not hearing back for 6 hours (left 2 messages).  Found T-Mont after a Google search and called right away.  A real person answered the phone!  Not only that, they sent Miguel and Joe over within the hour!  Super friendly and professional.  You'd expect professionals to say ""Should've called us for the install.""  Instead, they praised how far I had gotten with the sink install.

Miguel and Joe came out for the job and they were extremely friendly and helpful. Danny and Vinny were extremely responsive and educational.

The team was incredibly responsive and attentive during the planning stages, helping me choose the best solutions for my needs. They arrived on schedule every day and worked efficiently, tackling everything from installing new water lines to setting up fixtures with precision.

What truly stood out was their attention to detail. They ensured that every aspect of the plumbing was not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing, seamlessly integrating everything into my remodel.

Honest as well never try to have you pay for services or things not needed. That is hard to find these days. Highly Recommend.; I called Able as I had a kitchen and bathroom sink blockage. I  spoke to Frank who was friendly and who quickly set up an appointment.  Dean was the technician sent. He was friendly and informative and he answered all my questions and concerns. I was completely satisfied with the work performed and the price. I would highly recommend Able services.; I called Able S.O.S to get 2 drain’s unclogged, Worker showed up and gave me a quote and here it goes : 1st drain to unclog $425
Second drain to unclog $325,  so at that point I told Him I would shop around. I was never told whilst making this appointment that there was a service call of $195. I feel completely ripped off!!!! These guys were just making up numbers for each individual unclog. Absolute rip off !!! Do not hire these people!!!!; I am a realtor in Central NJ and needed a drain cleaned for a client in need in Jersey City NJ. I used Able SOS for work I needed done years ago so I gave my client their info. My client called me to let me know how professional, efficient and friendly their experience was with this company. They were extremely neat and protected my clients property while getting the job done and in the end that is what we want as customers. Highly recommended.
Thanks SOS for making me look good.; Jim came highly recommended by a friend and he was great!  Some other company said we needed a $1400 job but luckily my husband didn't trust them.  So I reached out to friends on FB and Jim was recommended.  He came and did an assessment, explained things to my husband and said definitely not a $1400.  He snaked out our main pipe that goes out to the sewer line and charged us a very reasonable price...no where near $1400.  We will use Jim again in the future."

Plumber arrived on time, was clean and neat and explained everything. The leak was fixed and cartridges were replaced. Cleaned up nicely as well.  Will definitely use them again if needed.; I had an issue with my shower drain clogging up. It got to the point where it became a dire emergency. Called Evergreen’s after hours call center and was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I received a response. Alex called me back within minutes and dispatched a crew that arrived in under an hour! The men were very professional, clean, courteous, and took great care protecting my apartment before bringing in their heavy duty snake machine to address the tub stoppage. They cleared my stoppage and had my drain line good as new in less than an hour. Would highly recommend to anyone who needs a 24/7 emergency plumber. Will definitely use again if I have an issue.; I had a clogged drain that caused flooding in my basement. Evergreen sent a plumber @ 9am sharp. The gentlemen was on time, well dressed, and very professional. Not only did he clear the clog, he also made me aware of a major issue that I can have in the near future. Overall, Evergreen's response time was quick, they didn't make a mess, and my issue was fixed at a fair price. I'll definitely use them again."

I am a property manager in NYC and have used their services and recommended them countless times in the last 15+ years. They are my go-to plumber for 2 main reasons- 1- you can trust what Carlos tells you, and 2- they never leave you in the lurch on a job, regardless of day or hour.; Cosme is Very, Very nice, with great customer relations skills. I called him early on a Saturday morning due to a pipe connection break. He patiently answered all of my questions (unlike another plumber who was irritated by questions, told me to fix it myself and hung up on me when I asked for an estimated arrival time).

Cosme was easy to reach even though he already was busy with jobs for the day - at 10am on a Saturday, which for me was a sign that he must be good. Being already so busy for the day, he was honest and told me he wasn't certain of an estimated arrival time, but offered to call me later with an update when he had a better idea of his arrival time.  He also recommended another company in case he couldn't make it, or if the building wouldn't permit him access for not having proof of insurance with him (because a plumber doesn't have that on hand because it comes from the insurance company, which he couldn't get until Monday, which I knew to be true from having scheduled a plumber for the earlier renovation). He knew the quality of the other company, and knew that they had worked in my building before so there should be no entry problems.

PLUS, Cosme was the best price of the quotes I got that morning. Great pricing, Excellent, friendly customer service, and Honesty; that combination is rare in most any industry.
There was a mix-up due to my tenant calling for estimates also, and another plumber was able to arrive sooner, so Cosme didn't do the work.

Very disappointing.; Feel free to reach out to me on insta my handle is ellieprazier , I am happy to attest to the horrible behavior of this company.

I implore you to do your research and read all the reviews below mine. The below others reviews  encouraged me to write one as well as it’s important to check! Now I realize! I wished I looked them up before I allowed the manager of my building to send them to my apartment when I had a small leak.

I wish there was a way to contact the below other people who have the same situation so we could take them to claims court together, or report them to their licensor, please reach out to me.

1. They over billed me by multiple hours saying they had overtime  when they were in our unit for less than 1 hour as I was home when they came. The bill goes straight to our building and it was paid then passed to me with no repercussions of their actions since auto paid by the building then passed down. I see below this is their MO and are getting away with it. I did not research them until it happened to me and now I know better. Gets worse as they failed at their job.

2. They charged me for drop cloths,  random parts, and other random charges in which were not used in any way.

3. They were hired to evaluate a leak and did not catch it because two months later it imploded and bursted in the spot they “fixed”. I called another plumber myself instead of using the building manager's recommendation because of their over billing and was told it was not fixed in the correct area which caused it to burst. They will not return my calls.; Don't go near this corrupt, dishonest company who was recommended by the Super of my building. I wonder if kickbacks are involved because this company will not provide an itemized bill, demand payment for work that has not been completed and are extremely overpriced. If a plumbing company is needed, find another company. Numerous people have stated here and on Yelp that the building Super recommended them. Please beware and avoid using this company.; The team of plumbers at Systems 2000 goes above and beyond to provide exceptional service. Their kindness and helpfulness are unmatched, making them the go-to choice for any plumbing issues you may face. Don't hesitate to reach out to them for all your plumbing needs, you won't be disappointed!; Be very cautious if your super hires these plumbers for your coop apartment. I am not the type to write reviews, but I am shocked at the blatant corruption of this company and my building management. Swindled is understatement and I wish I did my due diligence of at least looking them up.

We had a small leaky faucet from a guest bath sink that we wanted fixed and asked the super to fix it. The super said he would need to call the building's plumber so I agree to the appointment the super set up. Systems 2000 comes and goes within 30 mins on a Wednesday afternoon can be verified on our nanny cam.

We get the bill from the building for 2 hours of work on overtime and extra charges for tarps and other materials they never used. I call the management company to dispute these charges, and nothing could be done as the building already paid them as it was billed to the residential complex itself and then was passed on to me through maintenance fees. I have called Systems 2000  four times and each time get different answers and promises to follow up with no one following through. Now my calls are just going unanswered because they know they need to refund the building or me directly.

I find out this is not the buildings plumber as I was led to believe, this is the super's recommended plumber and not only that but other residents have made complaints and that there is high suspicion the super is getting kick backs which is why they are continued to be pushed on residents. Most residents just pay it and do not ask questions, so it went unnoticed for about a year before my issue arose in June .

The super has now been fired, systems 2000 is not allowed to work in our building, however I still don't have my money back because the building is the one charged than passed to me. I cant even take them to small claims because the coop would have to and that is a much larger process. I am just out of the money.

I do not write reviews but this had to be noted and I wished I looked them up before hand because I see many reviews saying the same issues.

Now that we have worked with other plumbers I will say the average rate for a plumber per hour in midtown east is $165-$185/hr for complicated issues. $125-150/hr for smaller problems. We have inquired with 4 plumbing companies about pricing, so we now have a preferred vendor list for residents.

ChIJA53qhbpYwokRPJR1rJfZf1Q,Fred Smith Plumbing & Heating,"1674 1st Ave., New York, NY 10128",3.5,75,,N/A,"I regret to say that my experience with Fred Smith Plumbing has been less than satisfactory. The installation of my garbage disposer was riddled with issues, and I feel compelled to share my account:

1. **Initial Attempt**
- A Fred Smith plumber attempted to install a new garbage disposer along with an adapter to make it go from continuous to batch feed.
- Despite multiple attempts, the disposer remained non-functional.
- The plumber attributed the problem to an electrical issue and advised calling an electrician.

2. **Electrician's Visit**
- We promptly engaged an electrician who found no electrical problems.
- Shockingly, the original plumber had incorrectly installed the disposer, causing the malfunction.
- Correcting the wiring resolved the issue, but we were charged additional money unnecessarily.

3. **Second Attempt**
- Another Fred Smith plumber attempted rewiring.
- A dangerous spark occurred due to miswiring, nearly causing a fire.
- The power cord melted, yet the plumber left without replacing it.

Realizing that the disposer didn’t have wiring issues at all, we took matters into our own hands.
A simple air switch from a supply store solved our problem efficiently.

So we rescheduled a week later. The supervisor did show up this time, but after a week I had not heard anything from the supervisor. I called and they said that supervisor went on vacation and there were no notes so they needed to schedule another supervisor to go. So, a week later we scheduled a second supervisor to come take a look. After a week of hearing nothing I called and they said that that supervisor is now on vacation after leaving no notes and they want to schedule yet another supervisor visit. Not to mention that every person that I have talked to through this process has said different things. It is the most inane and unprofessional company I have ever attempted to work with. I strongly recommend avoiding Fred Smith Plumbing.; **UPDATE **
This entire response from Fred Smith is a lie. They are lying. I have phone records and emails to prove that they never showed up. They didn't ""come toward the end of the window"" and didn't have access... They NEVER came. They never called to even GIVE me a window the first day. I called THEM to find out the window, and both days, they never showed. I called them both days after the window closed to tell them I had to leave for work. Then, after 2 no shows Monday and Tuesday, they emailed to say the job wasn't worth their time. Exact words ""all our gas guys are busy taken on larger gas jobs and right now we don’t have the man power to correct your issues""... Even AFTER that email, informing we they were ""passing"" on the job, somebody called me on Wednesday saying he was in the area. Obviously, that was never scheduled since they already passed on taking the job. They are completely incompetent and unable to handle the rigors of city work. Do not use.

Spoke to them last week, both via email and phone. They said they'll come by Monday or Tuesday this week, but they'll call Monday morning to confirm a time.

Well, Monday rolls around and no call. So I call them. They say I'm next on the schedule and will be at my place shortly. I inform them I have to leave for work soon and they say absolutely will be there shortly. I call work and tell them I'll be late, hopefully in around noon. Of course, noon comes and goes and no show. I call. They don't apologize. They say they'll have someone come Tuesday before noon for sure

So, I call work and apologize, tell them I'll be in late on Tuesday as well. I bet you can guess what happens next... Noon on Tuesday rolls around, nobody shows up. I call. They transfer me to 4 different people, nobody takes responsibility. Nobody apologizes. Nobody has any answers. All push me off to someone else. Nobody helps but they promise someone will call shortly to reschedule.

Hours later, they send an email (rather than calling, like they said they would, since they were probably too afraid to speak with me after they kept screwing up) saying the job is too small and not worth their time to do... A determination they made without ever coming to my home!?

Never use them. Unprofessional. Never once apologized for wasting my time.

Bargain plumbing and NY Heating Corp are WAY better (and more affordable).; Set up an appointment, they canceled the day of (it happens, no big deal). Rescheduled for two days later, called the morning of to confirm with them and they told me my appointment was ""priority"". No one showed up, no one called to explain why, and when I called to follow up, I was directed to a call center (and not to actual personnel).","Andy did a fabulous job. He was meticulous and professional. I had many questions and he was very patient. He worked in my apartment for two days. He had a helper with him each day and were very neat and cleaned as they worked. It was a pleasure and I highly recommend  them.; I regret to say that my experience with Fred Smith Plumbing has been less than satisfactory. The installation of my garbage disposer was riddled with issues, and I feel compelled to share my account:

1. **Initial Attempt**
- A Fred Smith plumber attempted to install a new garbage disposer along with an adapter to make it go from continuous to batch feed.
- Despite multiple attempts, the disposer remained non-functional.
- The plumber attributed the problem to an electrical issue and advised calling an electrician.

2. **Electrician's Visit**
- We promptly engaged an electrician who found no electrical problems.
- Shockingly, the original plumber had incorrectly installed the disposer, causing the malfunction.
- Correcting the wiring resolved the issue, but we were charged additional money unnecessarily.

3. **Second Attempt**
- Another Fred Smith plumber attempted rewiring.
- A dangerous spark occurred due to miswiring, nearly causing a fire.
- The power cord melted, yet the plumber left without replacing it.

Realizing that the disposer didn’t have wiring issues at all, we took matters into our own hands.

The kitchen sink was overflowing dirty water everywhere. We need someone to fix it ASAP. Within 2 hour they fixed our issue.; Late evening pipe bursted. out of the few folks I called they only ones pick up the phone right away and come fix + clean the mess at a fair price (by NYC standards haha :); I’m still waiting for the plumber so this is in anticipation that he comes relatively soon and my sink is fixed satisfactorily. I called at 7am in hopes that my bathroom sink could be fixed well before I had to be at work at 4pm. When the company called back at 8:30 I was told that they would have someone here within the hour. Imagine my elation. I cleared out the cabinet under the sink so they would have space to work and got to waiting. Around 10 the plumber called and said he had just arrived to the city and asked what time I had to be at work. I told him I work at 4 but my preference is to have this done as quickly as possible. He said he would be here before two. I was disappointed because it was a far cry from the 9:30 I was expecting but still workable.  He asked that I take a picture so he could find the proper part. My phone was full so I ran to target to get a flash drive. When I got home at 11:45 he called and said he would be to me in about half an hour. I cleared space from the phone and was finally able to take the picture at 12:15. Around 1:10 I asked his ETA and was told about half an hour . It’s currently 2:10 and he still isn’t here. I just wish I had been given an accurate time estimate at any point of this experience. I need to leave for work in an hour and there’s no guarantee that the sink will be fixed by then or even that he’ll actually be here by then. I’m a bit frustrated. So he finally came. At 3:00 and it only cost me $900 to replace the pipes and wait all day to be late for work. The technician who came was very nice. I’m just very frustrated and very late even though I woke up very early to avoid exactly this. I guess I should have called earlier; The guy who showed up very late tried to fleece me out of $500 when the office said is was a $150 call out fee then I’d be told what the cost is, for me to choose if I want to continue, the. Once work done the callout fee waived. The call out fee was because I ‘got him out of bed.’
I told the plumber I’m not paying $500 and he said not to listen to the office.
He then said I hadn’t paid, which I had and had proof of via Zelle.
The guy also tried to sell me a new toilet amongst other things.
He was not professional, pushy and trying to con us. I reported it to the office.; I called at 3am because my bathtub faucet had a severe leak. They were able to send someone over 5 to 6 hours later.

Mike, one of their plumbers, is the MVP, super friendly and was happy to answer any of my silly questions while he was working at my house.

I appreciated how they made sure to be respectful of my family's privacy as much as they could as they walked through and worked on things. Very happy with the service. Definitely go with these guys."

Overpriced / overcharged - 1600$+ for simple work
Dishonest / predatory
Rude customer service (Jennifer)

Charged 1600$+ (6 hours plus $250 (5 valves at 5-10$ each in the store) plus tax) for dishwasher installation, valve replacement and shower cartridge.
We had to call another plumber to fix their problems.; BEWARE! Regret not reading the reviews before booking with this business!

I was referred to Pro-Tech by my building manager. First red flag - they refused to schedule anything until I filled out a form and provided my credit card number. Upon scheduling a toilet repair, I explained that I needed a wax ring and two new washers in the tank. They estimated 1-2 hours (2-hour minimum); I scheduled an appointment for May 10, 2024. On that day, I received a call informing me of their arrival time; the receptionist and I agreed on 10:30 a.m. (but she said they would be there by 10:00 a.m.). I arrived at 9:40 a.m., which is when the plumbers walked in (relevant later).

The plumbers walked into the apartment; as others have noted, the tone was not professional. The head plumber was unfriendly, couldn't answer any questions and was talking on his phone cursing. They worked until 10:30 a.m. and then left to get a part from a store down the street. At 12:07 p.m., I called Jennifer (office) and told her the plumbers still had not returned. She called them and then informed me that they were on the way back. She also informed me that the bill would be adjusted for this extended time they were out (having lunch, too?). At 1:09 p.m., they still had not returned so I called Jennifer again. They walked in at 1:10 p.m. and completed the job at 1:40 p.m. So in summary, the plumbers worked for 1 hour and 20 minutes and were out for 2 hours and 40 minutes! (The customer pays for their time out, too).

Upon their departure, I received the bill. Not only was I charged for the four hours from clock-in to clock-out (and remember, their estimate was 1-2 hours), they even tried to charge me for more time, claiming the plumbers walked in before 9:40 a.m. I explained that it was a point not worth arguing because my appointment time was confirmed for 10:00. Jennifer was arguing with me; I realized the other receptionist had tried to pull a fast one by telling me to arrive at any time. She figured the plumbers would arrive whenever and just bill me beginning at that time!
Anyway, Jennifer never took off an appropriate amount for the extended time the plumbers were doing who knows what getting the part. At the end, I was standing in the hallway on the plumber's phone going back and forth with her. I asked her if I can just get home to my desk and sit down to sort out the bill. She said NO, it has to be done now. I told her I do not authorize the amount she is charging and she said she has my credit card information and she is going to charge it then put me on hold. She returned and said the card has been charged (approx. $1,000) and hung up on me.

I understand they probably try to take advantage of people as most that live in these buildings work corporate jobs and either don't know much about plumbing work or simply do not care because they are too busy. Conversely, I have worked with many plumbers in rental houses and know enough to understand that charging someone 4+ hours for replacing a wax ring and two washers in the tank is ludicrous. Also, they charge for their (unreasonable amount of) time in traveling to get parts (when they should have parts available or be prepared) and still apply a (huge) margin on the material. I was charged approximately $127 for material costing maybe $20. Finally, when I made the appointment, I told them (in an e-mail) exactly what needed to be done so they certainly had the option of looking up the toilet model and getting the parts beforehand. I would have been fine with them charging me a reasonable amount of time to pick up parts on the way.

I tried to resolve this by calling the owner. Not surprising – he was dismissive and didn’t want to hear much. Usually, the tone at the top permeates the entire company so after my experience with Jennifer, I did not expect much from the owner. If I have to spend several business days getting justice, I will because this should not be accepted behavior. Meanwhile, I hope others will find this helpful and support small businesses that actually care about their customers.; My sister needed a plumber, so I did some research and came across this company. Unfortunately I didn’t see these horrific reviews or I would have never hired them. The overweight plumber who came had a very bad attitude and was not polite at at all. Dident answer any questions I had regarding invoices. He screamed at my sister saying call the office. Not to mention he smelled horrendous he also scratched my sisters brand new tile. Terrible  don’t use this terrible company, when I spoke to hr; A team of two plumbers looked at a small leak under my bathroom sink. The rude, fat plumber who did all the talking while his colleague worked announced that a flex hose needed replacing. The two went away, leaving their tools. A little while later the fat, unpleasant plumber called to say the hose is unavailable unless I write directly to the manufacturer. He said it could take weeks to replace and suggested I buy a $500 faucet set instead, then pay him and his buddy $200/hr. to install it (estimating the job at 3 hours). You do the math—we're looking at more than $1,000. I told the fat guy to bring the original hose back; after it was reattached, my leak was 10 times worse than before. I threw them out of the house and went to Home Depot, where I got a beautiful faucet set for $140, and used a HD-recommended plumber, who installed it perfectly for a total of $260. Never, ever, ever, ever call Pro-Tech for anything. I've rarely experienced such horrific service and nasty treatment.; Pro-tech Plumbing is definitely not worth the prices they charge! Rosie, who answers the office phone is incredibly rude! I booked a plumber to come February 16th, 2018, between the hours of 10AM-2PM (a large window of time). The plumber never showed up. When I called at 2:45PM, without apology, Rosie said, ""Yeah, they got busy they won't be coming today. You're going to have to reschedule."" I made another appointment for Feb 21st and got the same long window of time 10AM-2PM. I asked Rosie if I could have priority since I waited home the entire day for a plumber who never showed. She explained that priority is for emergencies only and my only choice was the long time window but assured me they would come to this appointment. On Feb 21st, at 2:15PM I called Rosie and told her the plumber had not yet arrived at my apartment even though he was scheduled to come before 2:00PM. Again, no apology! She said, ""I think they are in the area and will be there soon."" Think??? In this day and age with cell phones and GPS, why doesn't she know where her employees are, and why isn't she calling customers to apologize for their lateness and let them know more accurately when their employees will be arriving? The plumber arrived late, at 2:30PM to install a replacement washer. When he left my apartment, the washer was leaking. We later found out the leak was due to a cracked piece on the new washer. The plumber was in my apartment for 1 hour. We were billed for two hours because that is Pro-tech's minimum.  They were also supposed to fix a toilet. They said they had to order a part and they would need to come back. If we used them to fix the toilet that would be an additional two hours even though it would only take them an hour or less to fix the toilet. So, we would be paying them for four hours of work when they only did two. You decide!  We won't be using them EVER again! Fortunately, we are on the board of directors of our building and have a meeting with the managing agent next week. It will be strongly recommended not use Pro-Tech because they are unreliable and overcharge and Pro-Tech will likely lose their business with our managing agent. Pro-Tech can thank Rosie for her great customer service!","BEWARE! Regret not reading the reviews before booking with this business!

I was referred to Pro-Tech by my building manager. First red flag - they refused to schedule anything until I filled out a form and provided my credit card number. Upon scheduling a toilet repair, I explained that I needed a wax ring and two new washers in the tank. They estimated 1-2 hours (2-hour minimum); I scheduled an appointment for May 10, 2024. On that day, I received a call informing me of their arrival time; the receptionist and I agreed on 10:30 a.m. (but she said they would be there by 10:00 a.m.). I arrived at 9:40 a.m., which is when the plumbers walked in (relevant later).

The plumbers walked into the apartment; as others have noted, the tone was not professional. The head plumber was unfriendly, couldn't answer any questions and was talking on his phone cursing. They worked until 10:30 a.m. and then left to get a part from a store down the street. At 12:07 p.m., I called Jennifer (office) and told her the plumbers still had not returned. She called them and then informed me that they were on the way back. She also informed me that the bill would be adjusted for this extended time they were out (having lunch, too?). At 1:09 p.m., they still had not returned so I called Jennifer again. They walked in at 1:10 p.m. and completed the job at 1:40 p.m. So in summary, the plumbers worked for 1 hour and 20 minutes and were out for 2 hours and 40 minutes! (The customer pays for their time out, too).

Upon their departure, I received the bill. Not only was I charged for the four hours from clock-in to clock-out (and remember, their estimate was 1-2 hours), they even tried to charge me for more time, claiming the plumbers walked in before 9:40 a.m. I explained that it was a point not worth arguing because my appointment time was confirmed for 10:00. Jennifer was arguing with me; I realized the other receptionist had tried to pull a fast one by telling me to arrive at any time. She figured the plumbers would arrive whenever and just bill me beginning at that time!
Anyway, Jennifer never took off an appropriate amount for the extended time the plumbers were doing who knows what getting the part. At the end, I was standing in the hallway on the plumber's phone going back and forth with her. I asked her if I can just get home to my desk and sit down to sort out the bill. She said NO, it has to be done now. I told her I do not authorize the amount she is charging and she said she has my credit card information and she is going to charge it then put me on hold. She returned and said the card has been charged (approx. $1,000) and hung up on me.

I understand they probably try to take advantage of people as most that live in these buildings work corporate jobs and either don't know much about plumbing work or simply do not care because they are too busy. Conversely, I have worked with many plumbers in rental houses and know enough to understand that charging someone 4+ hours for replacing a wax ring and two washers in the tank is ludicrous. Also, they charge for their (unreasonable amount of) time in traveling to get parts (when they should have parts available or be prepared) and still apply a (huge) margin on the material. I was charged approximately $127 for material costing maybe $20. Finally, when I made the appointment, I told them (in an e-mail) exactly what needed to be done so they certainly had the option of looking up the toilet model and getting the parts beforehand. I would have been fine with them charging me a reasonable amount of time to pick up parts on the way.

I tried to resolve this by calling the owner. Not surprising – he was dismissive and didn’t want to hear much. Usually, the tone at the top permeates the entire company so after my experience with Jennifer, I did not expect much from the owner. If I have to spend several business days getting justice, I will because this should not be accepted behavior. Meanwhile, I hope others will find this helpful and support small businesses that actually care about their customers.; Installed brand new dishwasher that was broken when they left (didn’t mention it)
Overpriced / overcharged - 1600$+ for simple work
Dishonest / predatory
Rude customer service (Jennifer)

Charged 1600$+ (6 hours plus $250 (5 valves at 5-10$ each in the store) plus tax) for dishwasher installation, valve replacement and shower cartridge.
We had to call another plumber to fix their problems.; My sister needed a plumber, so I did some research and came across this company. Unfortunately I didn’t see these horrific reviews or I would have never hired them. The overweight plumber who came had a very bad attitude and was not polite at at all. Dident answer any questions I had regarding invoices. He screamed at my sister saying call the office. Not to mention he smelled horrendous he also scratched my sisters brand new tile. Terrible  don’t use this terrible company, when I spoke to hr; A team of two plumbers looked at a small leak under my bathroom sink. The rude, fat plumber who did all the talking while his colleague worked announced that a flex hose needed replacing. The two went away, leaving their tools. A little while later the fat, unpleasant plumber called to say the hose is unavailable unless I write directly to the manufacturer. He said it could take weeks to replace and suggested I buy a $500 faucet set instead, then pay him and his buddy $200/hr. to install it (estimating the job at 3 hours). You do the math—we're looking at more than $1,000. I told the fat guy to bring the original hose back; after it was reattached, my leak was 10 times worse than before. I threw them out of the house and went to Home Depot, where I got a beautiful faucet set for $140, and used a HD-recommended plumber, who installed it perfectly for a total of $260. Never, ever, ever, ever call Pro-Tech for anything. I've rarely experienced such horrific service and nasty treatment.; Pro-tech Plumbing is definitely not worth the prices they charge! Rosie, who answers the office phone is incredibly rude! I booked a plumber to come February 16th, 2018, between the hours of 10AM-2PM (a large window of time). The plumber never showed up. When I called at 2:45PM, without apology, Rosie said, ""Yeah, they got busy they won't be coming today. You're going to have to reschedule."" I made another appointment for Feb 21st and got the same long window of time 10AM-2PM. I asked Rosie if I could have priority since I waited home the entire day for a plumber who never showed. She explained that priority is for emergencies only and my only choice was the long time window but assured me they would come to this appointment. On Feb 21st, at 2:15PM I called Rosie and told her the plumber had not yet arrived at my apartment even though he was scheduled to come before 2:00PM. Again, no apology! She said, ""I think they are in the area and will be there soon."" Think??? In this day and age with cell phones and GPS, why doesn't she know where her employees are, and why isn't she calling customers to apologize for their lateness and let them know more accurately when their employees will be arriving? The plumber arrived late, at 2:30PM to install a replacement washer. When he left my apartment, the washer was leaking. We later found out the leak was due to a cracked piece on the new washer.

He even had the courtesy to put covers on his shoes before entering the upstairs area where he was to work, which I greatly appreciated. He demonstrated extensive knowledge and knew exactly what was needed for the task. His work was quick and neat. This plumbing service offers competitive rates compared to other quotes I received from plumbers in Great Neck. I strongly endorse them.; These fellas are fantastic! Kyle and Dustin are considerate and proficient plumbers. They were happy to answer all my queries about the plumbing work, reassuring me that I shouldn't hesitate to call if I have any more questions. They didn't utter a word of complaint about the challenging landscape they had to navigate with a hefty water heater. I cannot express enough how exceptional the service they provided was. I've come to learn that the company is under new management, which is clearly providing excellent service now. If you're in Great Neck and need a plumber, don't hesitate to call these professionals!; I had an issue with my water heater not producing hot water. The gentleman from Weston & Sons Plumbing & Water Heaters, named Kyle, was courteous, polite, and respectful. He promptly showed me the problem and, through no fault of his own, he had to relight the pilot as a temporary measure. The company is under new management now and they are really stepping up their service. I will definitely be contacting them again for my plumbing needs in Great Neck.; Dustin from Weston & Sons Plumbing & Water Heaters was absolutely exceptional! He showed up in Great Neck and took the time to explain everything to me in a detailed yet pleasant manner. We had a fantastic conversation while he was working, and before I knew it, the job was done! Thank you so much, Dustin! I will definitely be using your plumbing services again.; Kyle from Weston & Sons Plumbing & Water Heaters was professional, efficient, and left the area as tidy as he found it. I received a call from them asking if they could arrive a half hour earlier than our planned appointment, which worked out perfectly for me! I was initially prepared to have someone working in my house the entire day. However, Kyle completed the job and left within approximately 40 minutes. I was able to use my sink again and still had my entire weekend in Great Neck!"

They were curious and efficient. The repair was completed in less than an hour. The bill was reasonable and the owners were also were pleasant to speak with and gave me a really good deal on the price.
I will definitely use Avada Mechanical again if needed. I highly recommend Arvada Mechanical; I recently hired Arvada Mechanical Corp to upgrade my old water heater, and I couldn't be happier with the service they provided. From start to finish, they were professional, efficient, and affordable.

Their team gave us the best rates compared to other companies we reached out to, and they were able to get the job done fast without compromising on quality. They took the time to explain the process to me and answer all of my questions, which made me feel confident in their abilities.

The installation process went smoothly and their team was respectful of my home, ensuring everything was left clean and tidy when they finished.; The company that had been servicing my Knight/ Lochinvar HIGH EFFICIENCY boiler (radiant heat and hot water) was taken over but another that didn't offer on-demand service. Google search and a few calls hooked me up to Arvada based in Great Neck. Originally, I scheduled them for periodic maintenance, but then the system ""locked out"" and cool weather had just arrived and we had no heat or hot water. I contacted them and they (Mike) hastened the date and took care of the problem (they needed to come back early the next day to exchange a corroded valve). The workers (Joe and Dan) showed up on schedule, were pleasant and found the problem in 15 minutes without the high tech diagnostics. We are up and running for $500.
Of course they handle standard systems and can do heat pump conversions, so see if they can help your hearing needs.; TLDR: They demanded labor payment before doing anything but couldn’t do the job because they didn't bring the parts. Due to urgency of the matter, I had to call a different plumber and Arvada Mechanical (Jerry) agreed to refund. I chased them for almost a month and each time Jerry replied “will be process shortly”. Still haven't receive my refund.

I was referred to them by the AO Smith warranty rep to replace a faulty gas control valve. They quoted me $160 (and insist on cash) for labor to install gas valve control since AO Smith will cover the cost of the replacement unit.

The plumber demanded the cash payment before he performed any work. However, he didn't actually bring the gas valve control, even though I gave them the case number to the from the warranty dept.  He said they will order the part for me. I called the warranty line, they said no order from Arvada Mechanical. I had to call the warranty line multiple times to order the part myself. Finally, I got the part after paying for next day air shipping, but Jerry said he can't schedule me in. I asked Jerry to refund me, and he agreed to refund the $160 payment. I did a weekly follow up for four weeks. Each time, Jerry replied “will be processing it shortly”

If they actually send me the refund, I will update this review.; After the storm in September my basement got flooded. The water heater had to be replaced and they gas burner did not work. So basically we had no heat or hot water on Memorial Day weekend. Not only did this company come out on a Friday and look at it but they were able to get the water heater installed over the weekend and instead of making me buy a new gas burner they were able to rebuild it saving me money! My friend told me that there was a shortage of water heaters and that most people were overcharging. They did not. If I could give them more than five stars I would. They did an amazing job. Then I had to call them back in February. I had a small gas leak in the basement and Con Edison shut me down. The next day the temperature was dropping to 15° They were able to send somebody out on a Sunday morning to repair it and once again did not charge me a fortune!

When I called him back, he made plans to come back, but as soon as I mentioned the $100 credit, he said he’ll call me back and never answered my calls or text messages after.

They were very efficient. I had a problem with my boiler system. Within 2 hrs, my heat was up and running. And the boiler is so much quieter. I didn't know it was on, lol!! The following week, I had to call back for a leak from the toilet bowl. I had my bathroom remodeled, and it was still under warranty. I first called the company who remodeled, and they told me it would take 2 days to fix it, and it was not covered under warranty, and the price was seriously ridiculous!  Paul Yonkers came back again, fixed the problem, a great price, and in and out in an hr. What I found with this company was honesty and loyalty to their customers.  Not just because the price was good, but because they really took the time to investigate and explain and show me what the problem was. I would highly recommend them to anyone. Thank you again!!!; Yesterday’s install of our new indirect water heater, was the continuation of a very pleasurable experience. They were responsive, on time, professional and knowledgeable. These days when you request services from any company, chances are some aspect of the experience will fall short of your expectations. From our initial outreach, to their follow up, to yesterday’s install, we highly and happily recommend Paul Yonkers Plumbing!; Spent $9,000 to convert my home from oil to gas over the fall. When winter came around the boiler would not heat my home - would stay at 55 degrees. Called numerous times and the owner just claimed he was too busy and always with an attitude (surprisingly he didn’t have that attitude before we paid for the conversion). He sent one of his employees who claimed it was a clogged return line for hot water but that he doesn’t think the owner will want to take the job. What? I’ve tried to call other companies who don’t want to get involved with what they claim is a “faulty installation”. I’ve even visited the office where the owner claimed he’ll send someone to take care of it ASAP when he’s less busy. That was in early January. Since then, we’ve had to endure the winter with practically no heat. We have children, my father underwent a kidney transplant and this is really the last thing we expected after handing over $9,000. We even told him we would pay for the additional service, we just want the house to be properly heated.
The owner hasn’t bothered to follow -up with us. We are trying to determine whether we have some legal recourse or even report it to state licensing agencies. I don’t think is acceptable for companies to act this way. Till then, we have tried to work with other companies to try and fix this issue hopefully for next winter. Be warned; We have had several experiences with Paul Yonkers Plumbing and Heating now, and each of them have been fantastic.  The most recent experience involved our water heater breaking down.  They were busy with other jobs, but made the time to come by to help in our hot water emergency.  The problem turned out to be more complicated than originally thought, but they kept with it and ultimately resolved the issue.  They were easy to reach during the process, prompt, and they explained everything.  Five star service and fair prices.  Paul Yonkers is fantastic.; This marks my 19th year doing business with this very dependable, very professional home service company. My phone calls are always promptly returned, their response always timely and accurate. Their work flawless. The job is always done to satisfaction. In fact one time they couldn't correct my problem and there was no charge. It was an outside underground issue not within their domain.

You don't keep customers for twenty years by failing to meet their needs.

Thanks!; ; I can't say enough good things about Ventura Plumbing.   My wife and I were looking for a honest and upright professional whose business model is not based on up charging customers for general plumbing/heating services or getting us to sign up for ""VIP"" plumbing subscription services.  We wanted a smaller local company that did not route our calls from department to department.  They were punctual, professional and polite throughout the process.   The service technician discovered a faulty valve when completing the annual servicing of our water heater.  We had also used them to unclog our kitchen sink and investigate a small leak in our living room.   They were able to make an accurate diagnosis of our plumbing issues which were quickly resolved within a 24 hour time period and at a reasonable price.  I fully intend to use them for plumbing and heating services in the future.  If you are looking for a trust worthy plumber/heating service professional, look no further than Ventura.; "

I reached out to Alexis & Sons Plumbers LLC and their customer service was absolutely exceptional. They assured me that a plumber would be dispatched and provided an estimated time of arrival. Elias, the plumber, was extremely professional, courteous, and detailed the possible scenarios in terms of cost. He reassured us that our water would be restored soon. True to his word, everything was fixed, and he went above and beyond to restore our yard to its original state before his arrival. Later that evening, a call came through checking to ensure we were satisfied with the service. Elias also informed us about the Advantage Plan for any potential future plumbing issues. We are definitely spreading the word about the top-notch services of Alexis & Sons Plumbers LLC. Their commitment to customer satisfaction is truly remarkable. Thank you so much.; After moving into my new home, I soon faced some issues with my drains. Being relatively unfamiliar with local plumbing services, I began asking my friends for any good recommendations. Many pointed me in the direction of a certain Ruben. Upon calling Ruben one evening, he promptly scheduled a visit for the following morning to inspect my situation. It turned out that my old clay tile plumbing system was invaded by tree roots. Ruben quickly and expertly suggested the best course of action, also providing a cost estimate. We agreed to install a new sewer system and reroute it around a large tree in my yard. In just a couple of days, Ruben completed the task. The new sewer system was up and running in a day and has been functioning excellently ever since. Ruben documented the entire process with pictures and took the time to explain every step he took. I was extremely satisfied with his timeliness, quality of work, detailed explanation, and cleanup. Working with Ruben was a pleasure and I'll surely call him again for any plumbing needs. His exceptional work is a testament to the quality services provided by Alexis & Sons Plumbers LLC.; I contacted Alexis & Sons Plumbers LLC early in the morning for a quick toilet repair that wasn't an emergency. I got a response on the second ring, and a friendly lady took my details and promised to get back to me in 15 minutes after checking their schedule. True to her word, she called back promptly! I scheduled an appointment and was told that Danny would be at our Bethpage building within a two-hour window, between 10 and 12. Danny called at 10:08, announcing his arrival. He resolved the issue expertly! I highly recommend their services and won't hesitate to call them again when required!; We discovered two leaks in our sewer pipe situated in our garage and got in touch with a plumbing service based on a neighbor's suggestion. Brady was the one assigned to check it out. He was spot-on with his punctuality from the very first appointment. He devoted substantial time to identifying the issue and provided multiple solutions, taking the time to explain how the repair process would work. Brady also pointed out potential risks to ensure we were fully informed before proceeding with the job. His diagnosis was meticulous and the quoted price for the repair was quite reasonable compared to another quote we received for the exact same work. We decided to hire Brady to handle the repairs and he managed to schedule the fix for the following day, which was a major convenience for us. He did an excellent job fixing the leaky pipe and even helped us unclog a bathtub. I would strongly recommend this plumbing service to anyone in the Bethpage area.; We faced a plumbing complication at our project in Bethpage, and Brady from Alexis & Sons Plumbers LLC arrived and resolved our plumbing dilemma within a day!

Initially, I was under the impression that our hot water tank was broken, as it had been drained and switched off. However, William honestly and efficiently filled it up and turned it back on. Later on, we suspected a broken pipe under our house in Caldwell, only to discover it was merely condensation from the air conditioner due to a lack of proper sealing. Even though this wasn't strictly a plumbing issue, William took the initiative to seal it for us, only charging us for a service call. I wholeheartedly endorse these services and will definitely be calling upon them for any future plumbing needs!; I've called upon the services of these plumbers numerous times. They're always prompt and display excellent professionalism and manners. When I had an issue with an external tap, they managed to fit me into their schedule between two other jobs. They not only fixed it but also provided a spare tap for the one at the rear of my house, demonstrating how to switch it out if necessary. When my old water heater packed up, they replaced it rapidly, completing the job within an hour! They also took care of my shower controls, reworked the pipework under my kitchen sink, and installed a bleed and shut-off valve for the external tap. Their workmanship was outstanding! They even went the extra mile and installed a line for a potential fridge water dispenser without me requesting it. The end result was fantastic! My father has also enlisted their services on a few occasions, and like me, he's never had any issues. Their consistent good service is commendable.; After a misdiagnosis from another company, Wright Brothers Plumbing promptly came to my house. They provided a free estimate and used a camera to inspect the pipes. The very next day, they efficiently dug up and replaced my pipes. The whole service cost only $750, a stark contrast to the $2500 quoted by the previous company. The remarkable part was that I never had to meet them in person. Our entire interaction took place over the phone and through my security system. Jace, William, Shawn and another colleague worked on the job. They sent me an invoice via email after they finished the work, which I watched through my security cameras. It was done quickly with a team of four.

ChIJW73wFYsDw4kRuXD3bx-nvRs,Aquino Plumbing & Heating LLC,"122 Clinton Rd, Fairfield, NJ 07004",5,208,,N/A,"When we noticed water sipping out from under our basement floor which had been waterproofed 5 years ago, we were dumbfounded and could not figure out where the water was coming from. After almost a week, I called the company from which we have a maintenance service plan with. The plumber came the next day and the moment he saw our water tank, he immediately told us that it needs replacing and it could go anytime. He also gave me a rough estimate of how much a replacement will cost. It was getting worse and we had to use a dehumidifier to get rid of the water. I was emptying the dehumidifier tank 3 or 4 times a day. Finally decided to call three plumbing companies - one local who said I will be charged $175 just for a plumber to come and assess the issue even though I already said that it has a leak and needs replacement. Even if I was willing to pay the ‘initial assessment fee’ they could not tell me when their plumber can come; another one did not return my call and finally, I took a chance and called Aquino Plumbing after seeing a lot of recommendations from our FB town page. I left a message and on the same day in less than an hour Cyndi called and listened to the details of my issue. The moment she heard the word ‘leak’ she was immediately sympathetic and knew that it would mean replacement of the tank. She asked for pictures of the existing tank and the sticker to determine the current type and the appropriate replacement to be able to give me an estimate. However, since we have a very tight space in the basement where the water heater is located, I requested an estimate for a tankless too. Cyndi provided all the details and told me I can reach her anytime either text or call. After getting all the information and discussing with my husband, I reached out to Cyndi again late that evening and she responded.  She arranged for their plumbers to stop by the next morning and scheduled us for the tankless replacement the day after. Darren and Gabe came before 9 am, and started working on removing the leaking 50 gal tank and installed our new Navien tankless water heater. It took a long time because of the very tight space. Both were very courteous and respectful. They encountered issues with the installation but were able to figure out the best way to route the new pipes needed. Explained exactly what they will be doing before hand. They worked hard and made sure everything were connected properly. Explained the unit thoroughly and were very pleasant. Cleaned up after the work was completed. Very professional.

Highly recommend Aquino Plumbing!

He did a great job at replacing the pipe and our basement wash sink, but it was not cheap at $2,900.  He did have to open up the cement floor to get to the pipe, but it still was expense.  My wife wanted it done quickly, so we agreed to go ahead.  We had a couple of other small jobs that we wanted done also.
We asked if he could repair our kitchen faucet that was dripping and he said we should buy another one and he would come back and install it.  He also said he could replace our main water valve if we made an appointment with water company to get the water turned off and he would do that during the same visit.  He told me that he wasn't going to charge me to come back either since I had helped him remove the old cement wash sink in our basement and since these were just smaller jobs.  My wife texted him directly a couple of weeks later, after we bought the new faucet and he never responded to her. Then I called the office number and spoke to his wife who scheduled him to come back.  The night before our appointment she texted me to say it would be another $600!!!  I told her that he never told us it was going to be extra.  I could understand maybe $200 more, but not $600 more anyway!! I called the office and spoke to her and asked for Eddie to call me himself because I was really mad and upset.  He never even had the decency to return my call.  We found out later that the water company didn't need to turn the valve off either because our water meter is in our basement and we can do it ourselves!  Guess he didn't want to do the job or he just wanted to charge more money and didn't want to tell us while he was at our house.  He also used several buckets to remove pieces of cement from our basement and never brought them back!  Unscrupulous contractor...beware!!; Great service! I had a about 5 small plumbing jobs to do & thought not to do them myself. It was pretty easy for us to set up a mutually convenient appointment. They showed up on time and after I showed them the work, they took time to explain to me what they would need to do and the amount of time required.

They advised me on the parts to purchase and where to get the best and cheapest parts (which I later checked out to be in fact better than going to the big stores).

They advised on alternatives to my initial ideas on outright replacement of entire units to simply replacing the necessary parts, but were never pushy & left me to make the final decisions.

They were quick, courteous, reasonably priced and professional.

The reason I’m actually taking out the time to write this review was because of something that happened after the actual repair.

I needed to make an adjustment to my water filtration system (& I didn’t have the tools to do it myself) a few weeks after they had helped to replace the filters. I called and because they were in the neighborhood at the scheduled time, it was fixed in about 10 minutes at NO CHARGE. I tried to pay them something for their time, but they would not accept the money. Perhaps this was because we got along so well, but I thought that was really cool & generous.

I’m definately calling them if I have another plumbing job.; Just had a service call from R&M for hose Bibb replacements with Eddie. He arrived on time, explained everything to me and went about his work in an efficient and professional manner. Work was preformed satisfactorily and Eddie was a personable guy. Will use R&M again & highly recommend.; My hot water heater broke and I needed a new one ASAP  The owner came  the morning we called to confirm the problem, provide an estimate and had the job done within hours.  He was tidy, efficient and explained how my new heater operated.  He even wrote his telephone number on the top of the heater for my easy reference.  I recommend him highly and will be sure to call on him for my next emergency.; Eddie from R&M plumbing came out the day after we called to install our Pelican water filtration system.

We found out later that the water company didn't need to turn the valve off either because our water meter is in our basement and we can do it ourselves!  Guess he didn't want to do the job or he just wanted to charge more money and didn't want to tell us while he was at our house.  He also used several buckets to remove pieces of cement from our basement and never brought them back!  Unscrupulous contractor...beware!!; Just had a service call from R&M for hose Bibb replacements with Eddie. He arrived on time, explained everything to me and went about his work in an efficient and professional manner. Work was preformed satisfactorily and Eddie was a personable guy. Will use R&M again & highly recommend.; My hot water heater broke and I needed a new one ASAP  The owner came  the morning we called to confirm the problem, provide an estimate and had the job done within hours.  He was tidy, efficient and explained how my new heater operated.  He even wrote his telephone number on the top of the heater for my easy reference.  I recommend him highly and will be sure to call on him for my next emergency.; Eddie from R&M plumbing came out the day after we called to install our Pelican water filtration system. He was the 8th plumber we called and all the others either did not show up or did not return our calls.  He did a beautiful job and was super nice!; Great service! I had a about 5 small plumbing jobs to do & thought not to do them myself. It was pretty easy for us to set up a mutually convenient appointment. They showed up on time and after I showed them the work, they took time to explain to me what they would need to do and the amount of time required.

They advised me on the parts to purchase and where to get the best and cheapest parts (which I later checked out to be in fact better than going to the big stores).

They advised on alternatives to my initial ideas on outright replacement of entire units to simply replacing the necessary parts, but were never pushy & left me to make the final decisions.

They were quick, courteous, reasonably priced and professional.

The reason I’m actually taking out the time to write this review was because of something that happened after the actual repair.

I needed to make an adjustment to my water filtration system (& I didn’t have the tools to do it myself) a few weeks after they had helped to replace the filters. I called and because they were in the neighborhood at the scheduled time, it was fixed in about 10 minutes at NO CHARGE. I tried to pay them something for their time, but they would not accept the money. Perhaps this was because we got along so well, but I thought that was really cool & generous.

I’m definately calling them if I have another plumbing job."

His quick and clear communication via text is a testament to his professionalism. He assists you with permitting process. Invaluable service if you ask me . With expertise that sees him installing over 25 water heaters a week, Steve's reputation for excellence is well deserved. I wholeheartedly recommend Steve for your next project.; My experience with Pro Water Heaters NJ was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. They sent a team of inexperienced installers who clearly had no clue what they were doing. The installation process was riddled with mistakes and oversights, leaving me questioning their competence and qualifications.
To make matters worse, when it came time to provide the necessary documentation for township inspection, they completely dropped the ball. The first attempt to send the documents was laughable - returned back to them due to an incorrect address. The second attempt was equally futile, as they somehow managed to send documentation that didn't even pertain to a condo, which was specifically requested by the township. The third attempt, they again managed to mess up by reflecting an incorrect address on the inspection document, which unfortunately could not be used.
When we contacted “Steven”, he stated that he will not be addressing this issue anymore even though they managed to keep messing up 3 times. Now we are unable to complete the township inspection and on top of it the condo association would fine us for all these delays.
They leave me no choice but to file a claim with Small Claims court.
Overall, my experience Pro Water Heaters NJ was beyond disappointing.

Years ago I would go from plumber to plumber  but for the last ten years I do not even consider contacting a plumber other  than because  Sanitary has proven they are the best. From management to  the skilled people they send to do the jobs,   all are professional,  skilled and personable.  They arrive on time and if delayed, will call.  True they are not the cheapest but  not the most expensive either , they stand by their work without question and are all a pleasure to work with.; Sanitary Plumbing is fantastic!  Alex and Jerry fixed an old toilet that 4 previous plumbers could not!  I had just about given up, as the previous plumbers all said there was no replacement part available and the bathroom would need to be ripped apart to install a new toilet.  Someone who has used Sanitary Plumbing for the housing complexes he manages suggested I try them - so glad I did!  Responsive and polite customer service, fast follow-up and then these pros had the problem fixed in one and a half hours.  They are the BEST!; A simple job to replace a bathroom shower/tub button that regulates water flow was done in less than 1 hour. The result was water leaking into the downstairs apartment and they had to come back while still in the building to fix their mistake....and charged additional work time. After speaking to Evan (Service Mgr), he insisted that that additional time was charged to the building....instead of owning up to their mistake and as outlined in their services, they seemed only be interested in charging customers.
This job that should have been $180+tax was charged out for over $400....done in Brooklyn....I will not use them again and would not recommend them.
I understand supply & demand and high prices but only accept them for a job well done but not like this; Short version: Sanitary Plumbing got a simple job done but significantly overbilled and breached my trust.

Long version:
My one-hole kitchen faucet was due for a change. I engaged Sanitary Plumbing, who came recommended by the handymen in my building. Before the plumbers arrived, I made all the necessary preparations: buying the replacement faucet, clearing out the space near the sink, and notifying my building's handymen in advance to shut off the water.

On the day of service, two plumbers arrived promptly at the agreed-upon time. Good first impression and gained a bit of my trust. So, I welcomed them and got back to work (from home). Unbeknownst to me, they idled for over an hour for the water to drain (and I know draining can take a few minutes, but something was clearly amiss if it didn't do so for over an hour). The plumbers didn't contact the handymen in my building or give me a nudge. Over an hour later, I noticed no real plumbing work had been done and finally got our handymen involved to properly shut off the water so that work could begin, another 15+ minutes later. (Keep track: That's about 1.5 hours of total idle time, billed at $195/hour, before real work began.)

I recognize that the water not shutting off for as long as it did was due to an oversight by my handymen. Still, I was surprised the plumbers from Sanitary Plumbing, given their experience, didn't have the initiative to do anything after an hour had passed, an hour in which they did nothing--no communication or work--but wait. In retrospect, I cannot imagine how much longer the plumbers would've waited before taking action. I had to intervene to move us forward.

So, it seems that billing more time (by idling around) was prioritized over getting work done efficiently.

In the end, the plumbers billed me 4.5 hours when they were at my home for only 2.5 hours (this figure includes the 1.5ish hour they wasted, so real work delivered was around an hour at best). Even if 2.5 hours was acceptable as the baseline, the math still doesn't add up. Adding one hour of travel time to my home (which, by the way, Sanitary bills for at the same $195/hour rate as actual work performed), 2.5 hours of being at my place + 1 hour of travel-to-my-home = 3.5 hours in total should have been the maximum hours billed.

I was foolish (exacerbated by having been rushed between work meetings) to sign their work ticket without reviewing the start and end times properly--a costly lesson learned. Because they have the signed ticket, and I only have my words (and those of the handymen in my building), I paid the $1,000+ they charged. A ludicrous amount for a simple kitchen faucet swap.

As a customer, I cannot help but feel like I was taken advantage of. I just wanted a plumbing service that I could trust and not have to micromanage.

I gave them two stars because the quality of the installation seems OK so far. No leaks, and water pressure seems good. However, for the price and the simplicity of the job, the result is nothing extraordinary. Only about two weeks has passed, so only time will reveal the true quality delivered. I will update this review if anything of note arises.

I'm likely a tiny retail customer among the myriad of clientele they have, but I hope this review will prove illuminating for others considering Sanitary Plumbing.; I highly recommend and told my friends to use Sanitary Plumbing.  I had my toilet, sink and faucet replaced and a vanity added.   The plumbers did a fantastic job.  And contrary to other plumbers that I have used there was no hard sell to get me to buy from them.   When I asked for recommendations on where to buy, they gave me several names--no kickbacks.  The one I chose was an excellent choice.  Also, very friendly and cleaned up thoroughly before they left.
I must also add that I had great and immediate service whenever I called or emailed.
Sanitary plumbing is the only plumbing service that my Super uses and he is VERY picky.  I will be using them again for my kitchen renovation.

ChIJiSVYHUf1wokRVFqAKocVTAk,Adams Brothers Plumbing LLC,"915 Castle Hill Ave, Bronx, NY 10473",3.8,4,,N/A,"I had such a positive experience! My sink began leaking during an extremely cold week, but thankfully it wasn't due to frozen pipes. Despite reaching out to numerous plumbing services, I was constantly told that I was not a high priority due to the influx of frozen pipe issues. However, when I contacted a certain plumbing service, they were incredibly understanding and made my issue a priority, regardless of the many emergencies they were handling. In no time at all, they dispatched Wayne to my home. He was fantastic! He quickly identified that my faucet was old and needed to be replaced. Wayne went out of his way to fetch a new faucet for me. When I reached out to him post his visit to request an upgrade, he was extremely accommodating and even provided some suggestions. Based on my preference, Wayne selected a stunning model for me. He installed the new faucet effortlessly and took great care to keep the area dry, even though I was running short of paper towels at the time. All in all, Wayne was outstanding and the plumbing service truly lived up to their reputation of swift service. I can't recommend them enough!; This is one amazing plumbing service! Our primary water line had ruptured, and we reached out to a plumber who boasted of 24/7 services. Their response was, 'We might be able to slot you in sometime next week.' Our second attempt yielded the same reaction, but then a buddy shared his positive encounter with a certain plumbing service. So, I decided to give them a call next. A super friendly lady named Jennifer picked up the line, telling me she'd have to consult with her crew and ring me back. In a matter of hours, our issue was sorted out by three of their staffers. Even with the chilly weather and the messy combination of mud and water obstructing their work, they remained cordial and kept me updated on the progress. I was awed by their ability to tackle the issue in the quickest time possible. The very next day, our hot water heater decided to quit. Once again, I had a chat with Jennifer. The team was at our Bronx location in no time to handle that issue as well. Dillon, Marvin, and Sebastian from their crew really earn a five-star rating for their top-notch service. Great job, guys!; it was fantastic teaming up with nathan and dillon to have a new tankless gas water heater set up in my home. while seeking out local plumbers, i happened upon a certain company. they are definitely worthy of their 5-star reviews. i collaborated with dillon to gather pictures to back up my expense estimate. when i decided to proceed, nathan was sent out to carry out the installation. nathan is extremely thorough and pays close attention to detail. he didn't rush, taking the time to ensure everything looked tidy, worked as it should, and liaised with us to modify the water pressure all around the house. he certainly goes the extra mile in his work and we were grateful for it. this plumbing company has gained a loyal customer in me, and i'll recommend them to anyone considering installing a tankless water heater. brilliant job with the install, nathan. it was a delight working with dillon on the estimate.; IM A PLUMBING PROFESSIONAL  I CALLED AND WALKED TO THE CASTLE HILL LOCATION, NO PLUMBERS HERE NOT EVEN A SHOP, NO VANS ..... CALL THE NUMBER ITS AN ANSWERING SERVICE... JUST PUTTING IT OUT THERE","This is one amazing plumbing service! Our primary water line had ruptured, and we reached out to a plumber who boasted of 24/7 services. Their response was, 'We might be able to slot you in sometime next week.' Our second attempt yielded the same reaction, but then a buddy shared his positive encounter with a certain plumbing service. So, I decided to give them a call next. A super friendly lady named Jennifer picked up the line, telling me she'd have to consult with her crew and ring me back. In a matter of hours, our issue was sorted out by three of their staffers. Even with the chilly weather and the messy combination of mud and water obstructing their work, they remained cordial and kept me updated on the progress. I was awed by their ability to tackle the issue in the quickest time possible. The very next day, our hot water heater decided to quit. Once again, I had a chat with Jennifer. The team was at our Bronx location in no time to handle that issue as well. Dillon, Marvin, and Sebastian from their crew really earn a five-star rating for their top-notch service. Great job, guys!; I had such a positive experience! My sink began leaking during an extremely cold week, but thankfully it wasn't due to frozen pipes. Despite reaching out to numerous plumbing services, I was constantly told that I was not a high priority due to the influx of frozen pipe issues. However, when I contacted a certain plumbing service, they were incredibly understanding and made my issue a priority, regardless of the many emergencies they were handling. In no time at all, they dispatched Wayne to my home. He was fantastic! He quickly identified that my faucet was old and needed to be replaced. Wayne went out of his way to fetch a new faucet for me. When I reached out to him post his visit to request an upgrade, he was extremely accommodating and even provided some suggestions. Based on my preference, Wayne selected a stunning model for me. He installed the new faucet effortlessly and took great care to keep the area dry, even though I was running short of paper towels at the time. All in all, Wayne was outstanding and the plumbing service truly lived up to their reputation of swift service. I can't recommend them enough!; it was fantastic teaming up with nathan and dillon to have a new tankless gas water heater set up in my home. while seeking out local plumbers, i happened upon a certain company. they are definitely worthy of their 5-star reviews. i collaborated with dillon to gather pictures to back up my expense estimate. when i decided to proceed, nathan was sent out to carry out the installation. nathan is extremely thorough and pays close attention to detail. he didn't rush, taking the time to ensure everything looked tidy, worked as it should, and liaised with us to modify the water pressure all around the house. he certainly goes the extra mile in his work and we were grateful for it. this plumbing company has gained a loyal customer in me, and i'll recommend them to anyone considering installing a tankless water heater. brilliant job with the install, nathan. it was a delight working with dillon on the estimate.; IM A PLUMBING PROFESSIONAL  I CALLED AND WALKED TO THE CASTLE HILL LOCATION, NO PLUMBERS HERE NOT EVEN A SHOP, NO VANS .....

I will definitely be calling him again if anything happens.

Good people; My house is pretty old and the plumbing is tricky to say the least. I have tried calling other plumbers before but often the old pipes leave them stumped. I needed a repair done and decided to give Latty's a try. I'm really glad I did because they did an excellent job. They were familiar with my houses particular needs and were able to get my issue fixed in no time at all. I also thought their customer service was wonderful. I really look forward to using this company again.; I had a plumbing issue pop up on Monday morning. I called Latty's and they sent someone out by that afternoon. They were so nice and took care of everything. Their team is fantastic and so hard working. They made sure that everything was working perfectly in only a matter of house. I will be sure to reach out to them the next time I need plumbing help.; I called Latty's to get my building's gas turned back on because there was a leak detected in one of the apartments and, as a precaution, Con Ed had shut off gas to the entire building. Ian came out himself to assess the job, described to me what he'd need to do, and the time frame necessary to get materials and complete the job. Within a day or two I had a quote. Latty's started a few weeks later. The job itself was pretty involved. Plumbers from Latty's came out on multiple occasions to do work, including a mandatory asbestos inspection, remove the original meters, lower the riser to meet new code, install new meter bars, valves and plumbing, check and recheck for leaks, and make tweaks to the system as required by Con Ed. They CC'd me so that I could view the updates from Con Ed as they went back and forth to ensure the work met the new city code. Throughout this, they were professional and competent. Not only the plumbers themselves, but also Latty's office support staff were helpful in completing the process and answering my questions. The end result was that the city, and then Con Ed, came out to inspect and gave the building the greenlight for gas turn on. Latty's gave me dates in advance, and a representative from them was present on each occasion.

Before settling on these guys, I was in the wild for a bit trying to find plumbers who knew what they were doing. Once the job started and I saw their work, I knew the job would get done. It was a relief. I plan to call on them again for any future plumbing/HVAC needs.

Latty's Plumbing gets 5 stars. Thanks, guys.; Called this company, discussed my issue, even sent him images as discussed. He stated that he would call back and NEVER did. Called several times and he continued to forward my calls. If company is unable to handle the job its best to let the customer know instead of continuously forwarding the calls.

The job was complex and demanded a lot of effort. Douglas patiently and expertly completed the task.

He professionally presented the invoice from Jared & Sons Plumbing LLC, which we were more than happy to settle.; My experience with Jared & Sons Plumbing LLC was stellar! They showed up just an hour post my call and swiftly resolved the plumbing issue. Douglas, the plumber, was phenomenal! He was highly professional and possessed in-depth knowledge about plumbing. His personality was simply delightful! A big thank you to Douglas!; I'm thoroughly impressed with this plumbing service. I would recommend it to anyone in need of unclogging drains or any other plumbing-related tasks. Douglas, as I recall his name, demonstrated immense knowledge, respect, and efficiency. The office staff I interacted with also left a positive impression with their promptness in scheduling appointments. I have nothing but praise for this business. It's worth noting that it's under new management now, which has significantly enhanced the level of service. If you're in the Bronx and need a plumber, this is the go-to place!; Douglas, the plumber, was very professional and polite, providing comprehensive answers to all our queries about replacing our piping system. His quick response to our plumbing needs in the Bronx was truly commendable! His knowledge greatly aided us in making the decision about our plumbing overhaul. We appreciated his timeliness very much!"

The tank was totally emptied with the knowledge I have dealing with gas tanks. First I tried to reach someone from the back door and no answer. So I entered the front and yelled out for someone and still no answer. The store was empty (no customers). Forgetting that there is a law that forbids propane tanks inside a building.
Nonetheless a voice sprang out and informed the bald headed guy. That I had an empty tank it with me.... ohhhh boy...he rushed at me as if had a bomb and tried to rip the tank of my hands while screaming! Had to hold the tank a little so he wouldn't have hit himself with it. A totally unhinged dude with an angry and miserable disposition. It was explained to him that that tank should have never been sold and I believe that got to him. He started to explain the law with no apology, so I proceeded to call him an A$$ H and a few other choice words..... definitely not a place to do business with. Felt bad afterwards because he's not a happy person and his upbringings must have been harsh, but nonetheless first and last time here.... Imagine all he had to say was please sir don't bring the tank outside.... Or had a sign saying no tanks inside? But it's all good..... After seeing all the reviews about this place I can't take it personal.... 😂 Poor fella.... must be hard being him!; Edit - 4 months later.  I just had my first filter change.  Attached is the 4 month us vs new filter.  🤔🤔🤔🤨

Reading the reviews I am surprised to see negative reviews. To those who had a bad experience I suggest be patient and try Shields again.  I would call the owners Kevin or Patti to discuss further.

I have shopped in Shields Hardware almost weekly for over 15 years.  This family owned company and crew did not stop working through the pandemic.  Shields Hardware was shipping PPE to my family around the country.

Due to all of our recent ""certifications"" in virology I decided to start cleaning my tap water.  If I must filter the air outside to remain healthy I should filter the water entering my home.

These photos show the before and after install of the pre-filter.  The main filter will be installed to the left.

What is very scary is if you zoom in on the filter glass you can see ""stuff"" in the water being collected 1/2 hr after installation.  🤨😲

I am very happy with Shields Plumbing!  This was my first experience.

Suggestion, if you live on Long Island do not procrastinate on installing a house filter.; As a French boater looking to fill his French propane tanks, I must say I've been very kindly taken care of by Pattie and Kevin, the owners. They both have been of a great help as is was not that easy. But they did the job perfectly, with smile and a real sense of service. Moreover, Pattie, as an artist :-) was very gentle with my two daughters, drawing little sketches for them.
Now I understand why this business is still here after more than 100 years in the same family, long life to them !; They tried to accuse my husband of stealing a propane tank.  It was our tank- we were just brining it in to refill.  No apologies at all once they realized they were being extremely rude.   Neither of us have ever gone back and we never will.

Now I understand why this business is still here after more than 100 years in the same family, long life to them !; Avoid going here at all costs!!!. They completely deceived us about their pricing for BBQ cleaning services. Initially gave a quote to then try to charge twice as much. Rude and horrible customer service. Not to be trusted; They tried to accuse my husband of stealing a propane tank.  It was our tank- we were just brining it in to refill.  No apologies at all once they realized they were being extremely rude.   Neither of us have ever gone back and we never will.  We now use the Alper’s and are pleased with the great service.; Edit - 4 months later.  I just had my first filter change.  Attached is the 4 month us vs new filter.  🤔🤔🤔🤨

Reading the reviews I am surprised to see negative reviews. To those who had a bad experience I suggest be patient and try Shields again.  I would call the owners Kevin or Patti to discuss further.

I have shopped in Shields Hardware almost weekly for over 15 years.  This family owned company and crew did not stop working through the pandemic.  Shields Hardware was shipping PPE to my family around the country.

Due to all of our recent ""certifications"" in virology I decided to start cleaning my tap water.  If I must filter the air outside to remain healthy I should filter the water entering my home.

These photos show the before and after install of the pre-filter.  The main filter will be installed to the left.

What is very scary is if you zoom in on the filter glass you can see ""stuff"" in the water being collected 1/2 hr after installation.  🤨😲

I am very happy with Shields Plumbing!  This was my first experience.

Suggestion, if you live on Long Island do not procrastinate on installing a house filter."

Ira Pabst; Hi. I had a great experience with Imperial Cesspool today, particularly with Sean. He arrived on time, and took great care in finding the septic tank. I had several choices as to how to proceed, including doing nothing for now, and he was clear and very honest in his explanation. I asked him multiple questions and he was able to discuss the options with me and help me make a measured decision. He spoke with the owner who was also very generous, given that they did a service call and I was not going to move ahead with anything in the moment. I worked with several companies previously who tried to get me to do all kinds of unnecessary work and it was a nice surprise to see a business that had both technicians and the owner be ethical. I would highly recommend them, without hesitation.; Rob and his crew were absolutely amazing. They were reliable, trustworthy, fairly priced. Rob was on the job the entire time. He is particular and makes sure the job is done perfectly. We could not have been happier with the service. I highly recommend.; The 2 Randys were terrific!  Saved me a ton of money!

He kept me informed every step of the way. This kind of professionalism on all fronts from ability to conscientiousness to communication is a rarity in today's world."

I was quoted a fair price (over the phone with a photo), given an appointment time which was kept, and the technician who arrived was pleasant, efficient, and cleaned up nicely from the job.
The woman I spoke with to set things up couldn’t have been any nicer.
Thank you; I was very happy with the work done by Matthew Dealaman. Both of our toilet flush systems were misbehaving. He arrived on time (actually a few minutes early), finished the job in a very timely fashion. The pleasant surprise: instead of charging the same amount for each toilet, he gave me a discount of sixty dollars since both jobs required one visit. This discount was offered without me asking him for it. A great job, well done.; Always great service from Above & Beyond. Had Greg stop by to check clog/leak and replace shower head. Thank you Greg- great job!  Oops, kudos also to Matt who came last Friday to switch out my shower control. It meant going into the wall and refitting the piping and took quite a bit of time. He did a fantastic job and I love my new shower control!; Very professional operation!  Left message to request an appointment and received a call back within fifteen minutes.  Had an appointment scheduled in two days - could have been next day but timing did not work for me.  Anthony arrived on time and handled the job smoothly - he was very pleasant and respectful of my home.  Would highly recommend! As a bonus, Matt, the owner, is a super nice guy so I am happy to give him the business.; Matt, Taylor, and all the rest of the employees literally go above and beyond. This time we had a mysterious water leak under our carpet in our concrete slab townhouse.

They sussed it out and recommended Water Leak Detection come to find the culprit. Once that was done, Matt came again and explained exactly what needed to be done. The pipe that went to nowhere needed to go outside of the townhouse to drain. Yet another of many Hovnanian construction debacles.

Their estimate was quick and reasonable and they managed to come and do the work within 2 days.
As always, we depend on About and Beyond for reliable and reasonable work done well.

We absolutely highly recommend this company.","Nice job and great customer service!

I highly recommend AEO Plumbing and heating to anyone in need of a reliable and skilled plumber. He truly went above and beyond. This was our 2nd time requesting help and they were super reliable.; Vincent was incredibly responsive and kind. He explained the problems to me and then fixed them up after making a plan together. This is the experience you want!!; Vince installed a whole house non-salt filtration system to replaced the ten years old Waterboss system. It’s been 6 months and we are very happy with the results. The best part is no need to buy salt.; My toddler flushed a toy down the toilet and after many hours of us trying to get it out on our own we decided to call AEO. Vince and Dino came as fast as they could and took the toilet off, only to find the toy (a hard plastic egg) had become a perfect sized plug deep inside the toilet. Vince is a strong dude but not even he could force that toy out with the metal snake. I thought we were going to have to buy a new toilet, which was a huge bummer. Vince kept on trying though, he finally got the toy just barely visible and took the toilet outside and had the genius idea of using a blow torch to heat a rod and melt a small hole in the toy, cooled the rod down, then inserted the rod back into the toy for a clutch retrieval. It was awesome. Even after all that effort and time his price was still very reasonable. He was also really nice and professional which is always a plus. So happy I don't have to buy a new toilet, which I think I would have if I'd called another plumber to come!

Finding out that Hackensack Plumbing is a fourth-generation family business was also nice.; After working with Hackensack Plumbing to satisfactorily correct a few shaky toilets, I received an estimate for a new hot water heater. The cost of the unit and labor was fair, and I scheduled a time for them to come out and do the installation the next week. For the following two days, the building elevator was out of action, and during that time, Hackensack Plumbing called to check on the status of the repair. When it had, they arrived and finished the assignment. Despite the fact that the replacement hot water heater was delivered the same day, the original unit tragically died two days earlier than anticipated. Nevertheless, they managed to meet their deadline. Their promptness and willingness to go above and above really impressed me. I highly recommend this team.; Expert installation work was completed, and communication has been outstanding. It's uncommon for most house installs that they could provide a straight replacement for our water heater. Most of their competitors wouldn't even consider installing a new heater, despite the fact that it was readily accessible."

The owner, ""Tall Paul,"" was so nice he agreed to look at my broken toilet right on the spot, without an appointment!  His skilled team fixed the toilet in minutes, It works great. He charged me a very fair price. ""Tall Paul"" and his team could not have been nicer, or more professional. Call this plumber for all your plumbing needs! He's a great plumber. His team is great, He's honest, and very fair! You won't regret calling him.; We recently used TP Plumbing for a primary bathroom and closet renovation. We had a very clear idea of what we wanted from the beginning, which included some out-of-the-box ideas, and Evan was a true partner the whole way through. He guided us through material selections, problem solved with us when we opened walls and uncovered AC vents in our way, and overall, made the project feel like a true partnership of the minds. It was a nerve-racking experience (as is any large home project) but especially since we had some unique ideas (ie. tiled drain, multiple shower heads working individually, a custom make-up vanity and linen closet, repurposing our prior closet system, etc.) Our ideas were never too much and in fact, Evan was just as passionate and excited about these unique features as we were! And although the workmanship was excellent (shout out to the marble tile team!), the real advantage to working with TP has to be the responsiveness and communication. If you're considering a renovation project, know that TP will over deliver on their commitment and they will work their magic to turn a nerve-racking reno into an enjoyable partnership!; I contacted Evan and his team because I had a 3 bedroom apartment with a kitchen that needed a completely brand new floor and I was getting quotes to do the work.  Evan came to meet me at the property the same day, took measurements of the space and discussed what I was looking to accomplish in the space, what my budget was and who the space was intended for.  So for some background this is for an investment property that I had and I was looking for something affordable but also visually appealing to potential renters.  He suggested I consider using vinyl plank flooring that look just like hardwood floors, are extremely durable and best of all affordable. In the past I had used linoleum but I've been increasingly dissatisfied with the way it looks plus it isn't as appealing to potential renters so I wanted to try something else and after discussing it with Evan it seemed that the vinyl plank flooring would be the best route to go.
Later that day he emailed me a detailed written estimate including the square footage calculations and what would be included with his services and what wouldn't be included. He warned me ahead of time that they would do the best they could given the floors were very uneven and I wasn't about to spend a lot of money putting down more plywood to try and even it out.  I went with his proposal because he made me felt comfortable with the process and I had used him in the past for plumbing services and they were always on time and professional plus their pricing was competitive.
He helped me pick out the flooring material to use, I ordered the materials online and he went to the hardware store to pick up the materials to bring it to the property. The entire project was done in 3 days (they're finishing it up today since the only items left is the touch up work on the floor trims, door trims and some caulking) and every day he kept me up to date on what was going on and along the way he brought up any issues that came up.
They completed the job within schedule and the floor came out fantastic.  I can tell you that I will continue using them for future projects as I trust their honesty and transparency which is very hard to find among contractors.  They completed the work as they said they would at the price that was quoted. I highly recommend giving them a chance and I've attached the finished floor they did for my project, the completed the floor and the finished baseboard trim and the trim around the doors.  The floors came out better than I had expected.
You can see below how the flooring came out, I'm sure i'm not going to have any problems renting out this apartment now, it really makes the apartment shine.  Give TP Plumbing a call and get an estimate, you won't be disappointed.; TP Plumbing added a second bathroom to our house.  After having six estimates done, we almost didn't book with them: TP Plumbing quoted us half the price AND half the time of what we thought was the most reasonable competitor, and honestly, we thought the numbers they were giving us were just too good to be true.  But TP Plumbing stuck precisely to the estimate they gave us and completed the job on time. Evan and Paul were wonderful to work with - they were always accessible, answered every question we had, and really walked us through our first significant home renovation.  In addition to doing beautiful work, Evan and Paul were just plain personable and showed so much care for the work they were doing. At the end of each day, they cleaned up and made us feel like we weren't living in a construction zone, which was so important with our two young children.  TP Plumbing will be our first call for our next project!; Paul and team are amazing! We have used them twice now.

From price of projects to knowledge of everything around plumbing to timeliness of jobs they present everything you want when hiring someone.; We recently used TP Plumbing for a primary bathroom and closet renovation. We had a very clear idea of what we wanted from the beginning, which included some out-of-the-box ideas, and Evan was a true partner the whole way through. He guided us through material selections, problem solved with us when we opened walls and uncovered AC vents in our way, and overall, made the project feel like a true partnership of the minds. It was a nerve-racking experience (as is any large home project) but especially since we had some unique ideas (ie. tiled drain, multiple shower heads working individually, a custom make-up vanity and linen closet, repurposing our prior closet system, etc.) Our ideas were never too much and in fact, Evan was just as passionate and excited about these unique features as we were! And although the workmanship was excellent (shout out to the marble tile team!), the real advantage to working with TP has to be the responsiveness and communication. If you're considering a renovation project, know that TP will over deliver on their commitment and they will work their magic to turn a nerve-racking reno into an enjoyable partnership!; I contacted Evan and his team because I had a 3 bedroom apartment with a kitchen that needed a completely brand new floor and I was getting quotes to do the work.  Evan came to meet me at the property the same day, took measurements of the space and discussed what I was looking to accomplish in the space, what my budget was and who the space was intended for.  So for some background this is for an investment property that I had and I was looking for something affordable but also visually appealing to potential renters.  He suggested I consider using vinyl plank flooring that look just like hardwood floors, are extremely durable and best of all affordable. In the past I had used linoleum but I've been increasingly dissatisfied with the way it looks plus it isn't as appealing to potential renters so I wanted to try something else and after discussing it with Evan it seemed that the vinyl plank flooring would be the best route to go.
Later that day he emailed me a detailed written estimate including the square footage calculations and what would be included with his services and what wouldn't be included. He warned me ahead of time that they would do the best they could given the floors were very uneven and I wasn't about to spend a lot of money putting down more plywood to try and even it out.  I went with his proposal because he made me felt comfortable with the process and I had used him in the past for plumbing services and they were always on time and professional plus their pricing was competitive.
He helped me pick out the flooring material to use, I ordered the materials online and he went to the hardware store to pick up the materials to bring it to the property. The entire project was done in 3 days (they're finishing it up today since the only items left is the touch up work on the floor trims, door trims and some caulking) and every day he kept me up to date on what was going on and along the way he brought up any issues that came up.
They completed the job within schedule and the floor came out fantastic.  I can tell you that I will continue using them for future projects as I trust their honesty and transparency which is very hard to find among contractors.  They completed the work as they said they would at the price that was quoted. I highly recommend giving them a chance and I've attached the finished floor they did for my project, the completed the floor and the finished baseboard trim and the trim around the doors.  The floors came out better than I had expected.
You can see below how the flooring came out, I'm sure i'm not going to have any problems renting out this apartment now, it really makes the apartment shine.  Give TP Plumbing a call and get an estimate, you won't be disappointed.; TP Plumbing added a second bathroom to our house.  After having six estimates done, we almost didn't book with them: TP Plumbing quoted us half the price AND half the time of what we thought was the most reasonable competitor, and honestly, we thought the numbers they were giving us were just too good to be true.  But TP Plumbing stuck precisely to the estimate they gave us and completed the job on time. Evan and Paul were wonderful to work with - they were always accessible, answered every question we had, and really walked us through our first significant home renovation.  In addition to doing beautiful work, Evan and Paul were just plain personable and showed so much care for the work they were doing. At the end of each day, they cleaned up and made us feel like we weren't living in a construction zone, which was so important with our two young children.  TP Plumbing will be our first call for our next project!"

ChIJAQBs7nyMwokR2yhdJp2mFJo,City Island Plumbing and Heating,"591 City Island Ave, Bronx, NY 10464",1,1,,N/A,"Directly from their website: “it's our top priority to provide the best customer service of any plumbing and heating company.”

This statement is the absolute opposite of my experience.  About two weeks ago I contacted City Island Plumbing for a routine job.  They came reasonably quickly to install a washer and dryer and a “slop sink” (because there was not sink or gas hookup).

One plumber arrived, looked at the space in the basement and called back to the office to get a quote.  He had the call on speaker phone and the individual in the line gave him one price, he gave me a second price (higher than the office gave him).  The difference was about $100, so I ignored it.  I said yes to the work.  He had to retune to the shop and pick up some supplies.

He came back with two apprentice plumbers.  They got to work adding the sink (connecting hot and cold water [to the wrong sides in the faucet], connecting the drain, hooking up the washer and putting a split in for the gas line to connect to the dryer.

The three workers seemed nice and I offered to and bought them all lunch.

At the end of the day, with work done I asked why none of the pipes were strapped to prevent future issues.  I was told that they didn’t need to be.  Upon quick inspection everything looked OK other than the lack of pipe straps.

I paid the plumbers (cash) and he said a third amount now $250 higher.  So I called him out and said we agreed on the previous price and that was all he was going to get.  He took the money and I asked him for a receipt.  He went to the van and wrote a paper receipt on a piece of carbon copy receipt paper.

The next day I went to do my first load of laundry and ended up getting a basement full of water as they had never properly connected the drain hose to the back of the washer.

They also had forced an old dryer vent line into the new dryer vent, linking the line and preventing it from working properly.

I have called every day now for two weeks with the promise that the owner will return my call or being told that he is out in the field and works everyday and can’t call customers back.  I have left nearly 7 messages for him to call me back.  Today I had to call three time because the rude receptionist hung up on me twice simply saying: “He’s not in”… …click!  Disconnected.

I simply wanted to share my concern about the first quote and two misrepresented costs from the plumber.  But maybe there is a bigger issue going on here?","Directly from their website: “it's our top priority to provide the best customer service of any plumbing and heating company.”

This statement is the absolute opposite of my experience.  About two weeks ago I contacted City Island Plumbing for a routine job.  They came reasonably quickly to install a washer and dryer and a “slop sink” (because there was not sink or gas hookup).

One plumber arrived, looked at the space in the basement and called back to the office to get a quote.  He had the call on speaker phone and the individual in the line gave him one price, he gave me a second price (higher than the office gave him).  The difference was about $100, so I ignored it.  I said yes to the work.  He had to retune to the shop and pick up some supplies.

He came back with two apprentice plumbers.  They got to work adding the sink (connecting hot and cold water [to the wrong sides in the faucet], connecting the drain, hooking up the washer and putting a split in for the gas line to connect to the dryer.

The three workers seemed nice and I offered to and bought them all lunch.

At the end of the day, with work done I asked why none of the pipes were strapped to prevent future issues.  I was told that they didn’t need to be.  Upon quick inspection everything looked OK other than the lack of pipe straps.

I paid the plumbers (cash) and he said a third amount now $250 higher.  So I called him out and said we agreed on the previous price and that was all he was going to get.  He took the money and I asked him for a receipt.  He went to the van and wrote a paper receipt on a piece of carbon copy receipt paper.

The next day I went to do my first load of laundry and ended up getting a basement full of water as they had never properly connected the drain hose to the back of the washer.

The customer service was excellent from the office staff to the plumbers who always came ahead of con ed and d.o.b and even the owner stopped by to oversee the work being performed.

I had a situation where NYC Building Dept shut down my gas in the deepest of winter because of a boiler that was installed without NYC work permit. My tenants had to move out of the house to a hotel because could not stay without heat, cooking gas and hot water and this is where my headaches begun.
The minute LLG Plumbing came in, I could start sleep a couple more hours at night. Their installation technician – HENRY the best I ever seen in my 22 years as a small landlord with 3 buildings.  And I have all the plumbing issues you can think of with houses over this time.
The quality of the work is unmatched and up to city code, using the proper pipe sizing, installing controls on the boiler that the previous company omits and the end up re piped all gas line in my house.
If you have to wait on them a little for your turn, PLEASE do, You will never regret. On the onset it may be a little expensive, but when you stack up the price with the quality of work done it worth every penny.

The 6 quotes I got were all over the place in terms of a set price and conditions applied to the quote, IE, 7k if our road had to be closed, and 800 if we have to add a 90 degree bend. In a final attempt to get a quote, I contacted Empire Water Main & Sewer and given a quote within a day with no strings attached ""a soup to nuts quote"". I hired them and a few weeks later, after pulling all the permits the work begun. The team were great and were very respectful of the neighbours as they had to dig up our pavement and open up the whole road to fit the new line (it's a very dirty and messy job). I have worked with many subcontractors, and if you asked who was the best? I would say these guys. 10/10 and the price they quoted was at the lower end of the quotes I received and everything went to plan with no delays or problems. It's just rare to find a contractor who cares about their reputation and provides quality and not exorbitant prices."

A few years back, they replaced our boiler, and we were exceptionally satisfied with the job done. So, when we decided to refurbish our upstairs bathroom and install a laundry room on the same floor this cold season, there was no question about who we'd bring in for the plumbing tasks - we dialed our trusted plumber. Cesar has been to our house a couple of times recently and has been super proactive in communicating with us, even through text messages, to help organize and carry out this extensive and intricate project. We're handling most of the renovation work ourselves, but Cesar has been priceless in assisting us with sourcing materials and overall planning. We're eagerly awaiting Cesar's completion of his part of the job next week so we can continue with the project. We'll always reach out to this team for our plumbing requirements.; Edwards Brothers Plumbing Company is a trustworthy and reliable service provider, always quick to address any concerns. There was a recent concern about a potential gas leak. Cesar was prompt in his response, providing a quick assessment and detailed explanation of the situation. Most importantly, he assured that there was no gas leak. His patience and thoroughness in explaining the situation were commendable. Plus, he didn't even charge for this emergency visit, a testament to the rewards of being a long-time customer of Edwards Brothers Plumbing. I recall a previous incident where I had a leaky water heater. After a late-night call, Cesar patiently guided me on how to shut off the water, and Austin was sent over the next morning to replace the water heater.

So, we got on the phone around mid-morning to find some help. To our relief, Austin from Edwards Brothers Plumbing Company was at our door before noon. He quickly assessed the situation and concluded that our water heater was beyond repair and we needed a new one. Austin was thorough and swift in his work. He gave us a quote and the final cost did not deviate from it. The quote was very competitive and, to top it off, our new water heater came with an eight-year warranty. All in all, the whole ordeal was as straightforward as could be.

I neglected to get his name, but his professionalism, expertise, and speed in sorting out our plumbing issues were commendable. He swiftly unclogged the toilet and even spotted another issue I hadn't noticed - the tank was filling at a glacial pace. He rectified this, and the improvement was astounding! When considering cost, they are far more reasonable than any other plumbing service I've contacted. All in all, an excellent experience! I hope not to encounter any plumbing problems soon, but if I do, they'll be my first call! I'd recommend them to anyone, and I hope they continue to maintain their affordable pricing. As businesses gain popularity through positive reviews and quality work, their rates often inflate. But why pay more when their service is just as good, if not better, than those charging twice as much? Here's hoping they continue their excellent pricing and professionalism.; There might be many plumbers in Woodland Park, but just like everything else, you receive the quality that matches what you've paid for.

The reason they've been in business for as long as they have is their dedication to quality service provision. Sure, they offer basic plumbing services like rotor-rooter, toilet and hot water heater replacements, tasks that many of their competitors can handle, but what makes them stand out is their in-house expertise for tackling more complex problems when they come up. They really are a full-service plumbing operation with a team of professionals who are committed to their craft. Recently, I had an issue with a cold water slab leak. Tanner efficiently diagnosed and fixed the problem without causing any disruption, much to our satisfaction! My wife and I were blown away by their speed, skill, practicality, communication, honesty, and not to mention, their friendliness! This has consistently been my experience with this excellent plumbing service. I can't endorse them strongly enough!; Excellent service! Extremely proficient and helpful! We required urgent plumbing assistance at one of our sites in Woodland Park, and they managed to squeeze us into their packed schedule. Christie, who we'll call Tanner, got back to me promptly and was straightforward about the charges and their procedures. Tanner was absolutely pleasant. David was the plumber dispatched to our location. I manage the project from a different state, and David kept me updated and swiftly identified the problem. I would recommend their services for any plumbing needs.; We recently encountered a problem with a valve leaking beneath our sink and a fractured sewer pipe hidden behind a wall that required attention. I am truly thankful for the promptness of Tanner from Hayden & Sons Plumbing and Gas in addressing and fixing the issues efficiently. What caught me off guard was their reasonable pricing. They indeed charged us 4 times less compared to a few other services that attempted to exploit our emergency situation by imposing a hefty emergency fee. One such service even tried to add an extra $500 merely because we were in a desperate situation. From now on, I'll be relying on Hayden & Sons Plumbing and Gas for all my plumbing needs and I strongly vouch for their services. Their courteous approach was also noteworthy, and I particularly appreciated that David, the repairman, wore shoe covers while working in our Woodland Park home.; We initially contacted a different firm, but their reluctance to visit our farm led us to Hayden & Sons Plumbing and Gas. What a breath of fresh air! Their willingness to assist was outstanding. David, their plumber, was exceptional. He arrived promptly, and tirelessly worked to diagnose why our toilets were not flushing. We initially suspected that our septic tank needed pumping and began to excavate it. But David, committed to identifying the real issue, didn't believe it was a pumping problem. Bravely, he plunged his arms into the tank and located the issue. Thanks to his determination, the problem was swiftly resolved and we cancelled the septic pumping service, saving us $700. David's politeness and professional demeanor made it a pleasure to have him on site. He is a truly superb plumber. We will certainly request David again when we need help in the future. Hayden & Sons Plumbing and Gas are the only plumbers we will ever call. We appreciate their help immensely!","Promptness: Tanner arrived surprisingly early, which was fantastic for those of us on a work schedule! I neglected to get his name, but his professionalism, expertise, and speed in sorting out our plumbing issues were commendable. He swiftly unclogged the toilet and even spotted another issue I hadn't noticed - the tank was filling at a glacial pace. He rectified this, and the improvement was astounding! When considering cost, they are far more reasonable than any other plumbing service I've contacted. All in all, an excellent experience! I hope not to encounter any plumbing problems soon, but if I do, they'll be my first call! I'd recommend them to anyone, and I hope they continue to maintain their affordable pricing. As businesses gain popularity through positive reviews and quality work, their rates often inflate. But why pay more when their service is just as good, if not better, than those charging twice as much?

I found rescue plumbing & hvac and I'm grateful that i called them! The plumber that came out toy house was professional and knowledgeable, and he fixed the issue in a timely manner. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of emergency plumbing services as they're really the rescue team!!; I finally managed to find the google listing for this fraudulent business. I had a burst in my main water pipe after midnight back in August of 2022. In my desperation and inexperience with homeownership, I called the first emergency plumbing service that google showed me. This company sent out a “plumber” named Sam who, over the course of 2 hours, fumbled over himself countless times to apply a very crude and nonsensical patch to the pipe and barely attempted to shut the main off. He charged me $2,027 for this “patch” insisting he used extremely high quality materials that would normally cost more. Tried to make it out like I was getting a discount. Sleep deprived and naive, I didn’t question this even though my gut knew something was incredibly off.

Lo and behold, 3 months later right before Christmas, this patch starts to become undone and the main water line under the patch starts leaking profusely. I spent weeks going back and forth with Sam over text and could not get him to actually answer a phone call. In the meantime, I’m having to apply tape and putty and whatever I can to stop the leak. He advised I had a full warranty on the work (on the rare occasion he did answer my texts) and that he would come out when he could. After several weeks of promised appointments and no-shows from him and an inability to find the original business listing, I had to basically give up after Sam stopped answering completely and hire a legitimate plumber to actually fix the issue by replacing the pipe entirely. Looking back, I should have reported this company to the consumer affairs division of NJ and I will be looking into how I can still do that. I deserve my money back, whoever at this scam company is reading this. To anyone else searching for an emergency plumber, avoid this one like the plague.; They did an amazing job, they came and worked on the same day which was what I needed. The service was done on time and the price was fair. I’m satisfied and definitely would recommend.; Mike at Rescue Plumbing and HVAC is AMAZING.  He restored my faith in air conditioning service people. He arrived pronto (9pm) and showed photos of the components that needed replacing, which were visibly shot.

My experience with them has been wonderful! They are absolutely professional- responding immediately to calls and trying to fit you in their schedule ASAP (unlike other companies that make you have an appointment 2 weeks out)
Al understands the client's urgency. They are fairly priced and extremely knowledgeable. Al is thorough at explaining the situation, offering a solution and how to take preventative measures.
During stressful times, they have exceeded my expectations and because of their great customer service I will continue to use them for any future maintenance.
Thank you American Way!
Sincerely,
A loyal customer; Call BSE Mechanical in Ringwood if you can.  But if they’re not available… Called a half dozen other plumbers about my MAIN Line blockage (guests in town and nobody could shower or use the toilets).  These guys were the only ones willing to help me same day AND in the morning.  Technician (Ahmed - great guy) arrived earlier than expected (always a plus when you can’t use your bathroom) was polite, professional and patient.  Best part... he cleared the blockage the right way by doing things no other plumber did in the past.  And didn’t try and tell me I needed to replace this, and that, trying to get more money out of me.  And told me price up front.  Fast, reliable and fair price.  What else do you want in a plumber.  One thing that was different... plain white van (nice new one) pulls up and it’s a bit generic (no signage on van and not many tools in truck).  They say they are a Full Service Plumber so that’s cool.  Will definitely be calling these guys again.; These gentlemen are quality, knowledgeable, and honest people. 6 years ago they came to work on my gas boiler. The house inspector told me I need to replace it and it would’ve cost me $25k. These gentlemen came and fixed it for $900. Today they came back again and instead of charging me, they told me that it isn’t needed and it will pass co inspection. I’m so eternally grateful for not being scammed.

Their prompt and reliable service, combined with their honest and knowledgeable approach, has consistently exceeded my expectations. Not only do they offer great pricing, but their expertise in servicing my heating system and boiler has been unmatched, keeping us warm and comfortable.

So grateful to have found you.; My problem was whistles noise around my toilet. The first repairman Richard did a precise inspection and gave me detailed report with some repair plans. Then I ordered re-inspection to fix it. However, the man who came the other day did not know anything about the problem and looked not want to anything further. He said there is no more problem around it. I am confused what is happening. Why were not the jobs taken over in the company? I cannot order further works to the company.

He’s polite, professional, clean, neat, and knowledgeable!
He came to our home after 5:00 pm, on short notice, at the beginning of a long holiday weekend to get our air conditioning system back running. Another company, that we’ve used for many years, had come to our home multiple times and  “supposedly” cleaned out our condenser and added refrigerant. But after Al opened up the unit it was obvious that neither were done. The fins were completely clogged with debris,  and the refrigerant was very low. He also swapped out both interior thermostats quickly and neatly.
We can’t say enough good things about the AMC Atlantic team, and will use them going forward!!!!
Stu Bertram, Pompton Lakes NJ; Atlantic Mechanical Contractors of Clifton, NJ just installed a new blower motor in my furnace.  They also installed a humidifier, a UV Light, and a smart thermostat.  I was amazed at how quickly and efficiently the work was done.  Al and his partner would not leave until they were sure that my wife and I knew how to work everything.  They were absolute gentlemen.  No mess was left.  They cleaned everything up before leaving.
I would certainly recommend this company to my friends and family.
B. Glennon; Unlike the guys that we have paid for years to maintain our systems, Atlantic and their team were able to respond quickly to a boiler that died. This is for a church, and we really wanted to be able to host services for Christmas Eve. Team Atlantic literally worked around the clock to make sure we had heat in our sanctuary. These guys will give you very good service and attention. I recommend them without reservation; when my ac stop working i panick because it was 91 degrees  i called al an he was by me in less than ten minute he told me what the problem was and he fixed it in less than twenty minute im very grateful for al and guss they did a great job; On Dec. 18, 2023, our sump pump (primary and backup combined unit, 13 years old) was out of order and basement was flooded. My sister bought a new battery (good and fully charged, tested in Autozone) and connected it to the backup pump, but both pumps were still not working. Then she called Atlantic Mechanical Contractors (AMC Clifton NJ). A plumber replaced the primary pump (works until now), cost of $1200 (part market price $200±). However, the plumber diagnosed the backup pump worked normally and reinstalled it. The plumber DID NOT suggest to replace the 13 year-old pump either (now we know, pumps of older than 8-10 years should be replaced, no matter it works or not). 2-3 wks later, the primary pump worked as needed, but the backup pump didn’t when we disconnected the primary pump. Then we replaced total 3 new batteries from Autozone and all were damaged after connected to the pump, indicating a bad pump. In 2-3 wks, the plumber came back, and only told us that pump worked last time. I asked him to check the pump, but he refused and said that he is not electrician and doesn’t know how to do it.  So, how did he know the pump was working at the beginning? In another 2-3 wks, the second plumber checked the pump and diagnosed the pump was broken. Customer Service said that they are not responsible for the backup pump. Our questions: (1) our pump is primary and backup combined unit, if basement was flooded, that meant both are out of order. The plumber should have diagnosed and repaired the two pumps; (2) the plumber made wrong diagnosis of backup pump, which supported by: A) before the plumber arrived, our basement continued to be flooded with a new battery in the backup pump. B) We connected total 3 new batteries to the backup sump, all were damaged (confirmed by Autozone); (3) the plumber DID NOT suggest my sister to replace the 13 year-old pump. The work-done paper (receipt) shows no suggestion for replacement either; (4) we need the backup pump to work and AMC (Clifton NJ) should keep promise of 3 year warranty; (5) AMC service was full of pain. I spent a lot of time (in nearly 2 months, made nearly 30 calls total, I believe) in talking and debating again and again. My friends, customers and professionals, how do you think about my experience? Do you think AMC did a good job? Is this the right way for a company to do business and satisfy customers? What should I do to protect my right (perhaps court will be a help)? Do you want to get services from Atlantic Mechanical Contractors (Clifton NJ)?","when my ac stop working i panick because it was 91 degrees  i called al an he was by me in less than ten minute he told me what the problem was and he fixed it in less than twenty minute im very grateful for al and guss they did a great job; I highly recommend Al from AMC Atlantic for any of your central air conditioning needs.

The work-done paper (receipt) shows no suggestion for replacement either; (4) we need the backup pump to work and AMC (Clifton NJ) should keep promise of 3 year warranty; (5) AMC service was full of pain. I spent a lot of time (in nearly 2 months, made nearly 30 calls total, I believe) in talking and debating again and again. My friends, customers and professionals, how do you think about my experience? Do you think AMC did a good job? Is this the right way for a company to do business and satisfy customers? What should I do to protect my right (perhaps court will be a help)? Do you want to get services from Atlantic Mechanical Contractors (Clifton NJ)?; Atlantic Mechanical Contractors of Clifton, NJ just installed a new blower motor in my furnace.  They also installed a humidifier, a UV Light, and a smart thermostat.  I was amazed at how quickly and efficiently the work was done.  Al and his partner would not leave until they were sure that my wife and I knew how to work everything.  They were absolute gentlemen.  No mess was left.  They cleaned everything up before leaving.
I would certainly recommend this company to my friends and family.
B. Glennon; Unlike the guys that we have paid for years to maintain our systems, Atlantic and their team were able to respond quickly to a boiler that died. This is for a church, and we really wanted to be able to host services for Christmas Eve. Team Atlantic literally worked around the clock to make sure we had heat in our sanctuary. These guys will give you very good service and attention. I recommend them without reservation"

Given the age of the boiler and that many contractors are charging approximately $1600 to replace a $279 component, I opted to get a whole new system. I reached out to several contractors for quotes, including Diego from Promen HVAC.

Diego patiently spent a lot of time answering my questions, and we decided on a Burnham ES-25 boiler for my house. His price was reasonable, and he was able to do the job within a few days. He filed the permit for me, which I paid for and picked up at the town's office.

On the day of installation, his crew showed up at 6:45 A.M. and finished up around 12:30. The installation went smoothly. The inspector stopped by later in the week to check everything out. He found a tiny water leak around one of the couplings. With the inspector present, I called Diego and sent a picture of the problem. At 6:45 A.M. the next day, his crew stopped by to fix the problem.

Diego also replaced the dip tube on my hot water heater, since rust was forming around the coupling.

I wouldn't allow criminals like this in my house. Who knows if they are overbilling or stealing from you; I had been calling plumbers in the area for months trying to get someone to come and take a look at the flushometers on both of our toilets. Everyone was busy and some would make appointments and then not show up. I called Wynne and they were able to schedule someone to come out in a matter of days. They stayed in constant communication with me and let me know when the plumbers were on their way. When the plumbers arrived, they were knowledgeable and quick and were able to let me know what needed to be done almost immediately. They gave me a reasonable estimate and then went to get parts and completed the job within the hour.

Gayle Kendall and George Colucci - Upper West Side, Manhattan; AVOID THIS BUSINESS! Called Glashow to fix a leaky bathtub in January for a faucet that was not adjusting water temperature properly.

I looked up online how much it costs to replace a cartridge for a shower and they typical charge is 100-350. Living in NYC, I understand that they would be on the higher end of that scale.

Yesterday‘s problem was a hose that we could not get off the spigot. My husband wanted to use a hacksaw on it and that did not seem like a good idea to me. We had just had the house sided recently, and I didn’t want the siding damaged. Steve went right to work and was able to unscrew what was left of the hose quickly all the while describing how this happens and how to prevent it from happening again.

Great communication from start to finish and the entire team was respectful and on time.; UPDATE, Halloween, 2021 I asked Master Plumber George to troubleshoot a 30 year old steam boiler in an 120 year old house in Riverdale. There was too much water in the boiler and the water hammering was so loud my wife and I were frightened. George proposed a solution that did not require parts and minimal labor. I am enjoying a warm house now. Call George!

While the fix rolled out, George talked about his Geothermal and heat pump w/ solar projects he recently worked on, and suggested I look at The Lost Art of Steam Heating by Dan Holohan (1992, 2017).

==============
Living in a 1900's era home in N. Riverdale. Smelled gas and reported to ConEd. ConEd red-tagged natural gas system, leaving us without boiler, water heater, or cooking gas. As it turned out, thank goodness ConEd did that.

My wife did some research with Department of Buildings permits & successful inspections and found job descriptions and prices for several of George S. Bateman's jobs of similar scope. We also reviewed George's Master Plumber Gas Operator certs and his up-to-date licenses..

Called George who came out the next day to look at the vintage gas system. We received a complete estimate in two days. We put 50% down and he was here with his crew the day after next.

Other than the competence and honesty, the key advantage of George's firm is that he has an Expeditor who knows how to apply for and fulfill the many NYC and ConEd permit, registration, and environmental regulations.
Believe me, you don't want to do this by yourself without help. The fines can be punitive and cumulative.

The job is completed now and we are sleeping well with hot showers again and the comfort of knowing we have had fully-licensed and code compliant work done and fully inspected on this safety-critical system.

Did I say that George was able to find another very dangerous (between floors) hidden gas leak with his pressure testing gear? His crew spent an additional day to fix it.

After George S Bateman and three complete inspections by him, DoB, and ConEd we have not been happier with a NY contractor. On his own initiative, he even worked with the inspectors to move up the inspections so we could have our heating back on-line sooner.

George knows what he is talking about. Punctual, authoritative and communicative. My wife adds that his co-ordination was extremely effective with DoB, ConEd, and DEP.

================ UPDATE March 2024
We had a problem with the water auto-feeder which was not keeping the replacement water for the boiler at the right level. I’ve been in and out of the hospital recently and could not handle the valves.  George immediately send one of his most experienced plumbers, Willy, and he fixed it within minutes with his plumber’s arm, explaining as he went so we understood what and why he was doing.

We had multiple pipe breaks in our heating system and Ian replaced the boiler and quickly repaired or replaced every pipe. It was impressive to see how well he handled every problem my house threw at him and my house had A LOT of problems. Ian's professionalism and good humor made a very stressful situation much more manageable and now our heat works better than ever!; Excellent and attentive service from A-team Gas and Heat. Ian helped to diagnose the problem and provided repairs in a timely and professional manner. Also helped to give me pointers on how I could make my home more efficient. Didn't try to upcharge or sell me on anything. I've used other companies in New Rochelle and they just made me a loyal customer.; I bought a house almost 2 years ago, the boiler was older than I am, this past winter we were lucky it didn't break down, and I knew I shouldn't push my luck and replace it ASAP.   I'd had 3 estimates on replacing it, and the experiences in just getting those estimates was frustrating.  Vague estimates with no detail, hard to reach staff who could not answer basic questions about the equipment or process, and one vendor who never showed up for an appointment and then showed up hours late when given a second chance.  One vendor just mailed a 3 sentence estimate after I made a phone inquiry, never even seeing my house or asking about what I had in place now!

Then a neighbor recommended A-Team and so I called to inquire about an estimate.  Ian offered to come to my house on the spot!  He spent time looking at my heating system, and then wrote us a detailed estimate.  It was so reassuring to have our questions answered personally and in full about the work needed, equipment and process.  He was also helpful and knowledgeable when we asked about additional features/functions that could help with energy savings later on.  So we went with A-Team for the job, and they did not disappoint.

They came on time for the appointment, were friendly and polite, took care with the removal and installation of the old equipment as well as putting in the new stuff.  Were done before the day was over, and the radiators were working immediately on the new system.  The price for the job was fair, and also included a good warranty as well as 2 years of service, which is a significant value itself.  I was so happy I waited to find the right company to replace my boiler, everything went smoothly and I feel reassured knowing my heating system is in capable hands with responsive and experienced staff.; Had a really great experience with A-Team today. Our furnace stopped working overnight on a Sunday during a cold spell. After getting a pricey estimate and somewhat confusing/unhelpful diagnosis from someone else, I found A-Team recommended by my neighbors and thought to get a second opinion. He came by within an hour of calling, on a Sunday afternoon, and was quickly able to figure out our complex and tricky system and configuration. He was positive, helpful, and friendly- and extremely reasonably priced. And best of all- he fixed everything in a really quick amount of time and we have a working furnace- when we otherwise thought we were looking at a full replacement. What a relief! We will definitely be using A-Team in the future for our heating needs. Thanks so much for the great and trustworthy service!; I very rarely leave Customer Comments, however, I recieved such great service from Ian that I needed to share. As a Store Manager of a Major Retailer, I can appreciate excellent service. I called A-Team because I had an unpleasant experience with a previous maintenance company. The company had great reviews and was in close proximity to my home. I called and spoke with Ian who came to my home at the scheduled time, diagnosed the problem quickly and even called the following day to make sure I was satisfied with the service.

This company always calls you back right away, with courteous and friendly staff - like they're a member of the family.  Honest, reliable, courteous and reasonably priced!  You can't ask for better!  My water heater, which was new from the purchase of the house, blew out.  A utility company came to assess the problem, which they detected as the motor on a two year old hot water heater being fried.  I called Buchanan to replace it, and JT detected that it was not the motor on the water heater, but a faulty electrical outlet.  He saved me the cost of replacing the entire water heater - which still would not have worked!  So grateful.; I had a small problem of water constantly leaking in my toilet, from the flash tank to the toilet bowl, nothing major but I wanted to preserve fresh water and save the planet, so I called my favorite company Jannel plumbing. It turned out, that the owner of Jannel retired and this company took over Jannel's client database. OK, I decided to give them a chance, and I am sorry I did.
First, the plumber came 15 minutes before the scheduled time, despite the fact that I specifically called the company and told that I would not be at home... My wife let him in, and when I came home he already fixed the problem - he needed to readjust one screw in the valve to stop the leakage. Quick and nice, but then he said he would charge me for a trip $125 plus tax. For turning one screw  half a turn. As I said, I wasn't at home when he started, so I didn't have a chance to ask for invoice and decide if I want the service before he even started, so I had to pay. He also said: ""I am only charging your for a trip, I didn't put on the paper that I fixed your problem, otherwise my boss would say to charge you more."" Really?!
Besides, the trip charge for a plumber? Never heard about it, at least not with Jannel. I am sure they would not charge me anything.
So, this company - never again.; This company made my 2 plumbing services work out smoothly and cost effectively. They answered my pre service questions so that i bought the right parts to make a new master bath shower trim price effective but also more upscale and then installed it problem free.

Craig and his team have always gone above and beyond to help our family but today they went even further.
They are the most down to earth workers.
Clean, knowledgeable, understanding, and caring. They make you feel like family. They legit calm you down in emergency situations and have you laughing by the end of it all. They are cheaper than a therapist and by far better then one as they can also fix my plumbling while talking me through crappy situations… ha ha

Cannot say enough great things about them. No words can express it!!
Thank you guys  for today and past plumbling emergencies.
I’m forever grateful."

They were clean and courteous and they fixed the leaking toilet supply line quickly.  It was an emergency, so I honestly didn't compare prices with any other company, but I have to say I was happy with the service and would call them again.","A flooded basement due to a nasty leak, in the middle of the night, was a state of emergency. My wife was freaking out and I didn't know who to call at that time of the night. A couple of names popped up on Google, and almost all of them didn't pick up the phone except these guys. The dispatcher was very kind and told me that he can send someone, but I'll have to pay additional because of an emergency service call. Fair enough... so I agreed.

Their plumber was at my door within an hour and he fixed the leak for us. The important thing to note here is that this company is true to its 24/7 claim. They saved us from a boatload of trouble by showing up at 2 AM at night. I highly recommend this company because they will show up no matter what.; They are hands down the best plumbers I have ever used. We had a slab leak in our kitchen and they came over with the intention of doing a direct repair by jackhammering the floor and repairing the leak. But the plumber came up with a great solution to reroute the pipe, sparing our floor.

They were super prompt and about 20% cheaper than the other estimate we got. Glad we went with them.; I had wonderful service with this company. Our toilet was leaking into the apartment downstairs so we needed it fixed pretty quickly. They were able to fit me in last minute and make the necessary repairs and everything seems to be working fine.

The price they offer to me was reasonable and did an awesome job in my plumbing issue. Thoroughly explained what they were doing and left the area with no mess. I am happy also that the plumber gave me a very useful advice in plumbing. I wish I had known their service earlier. Highly recommended!"

Everything went smoothly from start to finish in terms of returning phone calls, receiving estimates, filling out paperwork, etc. They showed up when they said they would, and were very easy to work with. Omar was very patient in answering questions, and truly went above and beyond in his service.  Omar and Anthony arrived within a week and completed ALL the work in a day! He and Anthony installed a new outside spigot, replaced some corroded copper piping, capped another pipe, installed 4 new shutoff valves on water lines in our building, and replaced another worn valve. The Super Service company provided us a very reasonable price for the work. They also provided a COI in advance which we needed from insurance company, answered all questions, and had great communication. VERY PROFESSIONAL HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

We'll hire Omar and this company again.; Frank and Omar at Super Service Plumbers were amazing. I was so fortunate to come across them when my heat/hot water unit died. They promptly responded, walked me through the problems, replaced my unit, and spent the necessary time needed to fully upgrade and customize the piping/venting  needed in my 100 plus year old condo building to support the new unit. I can’t recommend them enough and it’s amazing to meet people who really care about their work and take the time to find solutions.; I recently hired Super Service Plumbing for a plumbing issue at my home, and I couldn't be happier with their service. Omar was prompt, professional, and efficiently resolved the issue. The quality of their work exceeded my expectations, and their pricing was fair. I highly recommend Super Service Plumbing for their excellent service and expertise. Five stars!; We are really happy we used Super Service Heating and Air Conditioning. For context, our furnace wasn't starting up and had already had 2 well-reviewed companies in the area who looked at it. By the time we reached out to Frank, we were thinking that our furnace had to be replaced and asked for a quote for installing a new one. Frank stopped by to make sure that the new furnace could be swapped in.

While he was there, he took a look at the boiler and the AC unit too, and pointed out various information about the system that I found useful as a new owner of the home. He then ask me if I want him to run diagnostic on the furnace to see what the underlying problem is. It didn't take more than 10 minutes for him to figure out that the issue was with one of the sensors (apparently a weird quirk with one of the common furnace brands). He then ordered the part and, the next day, Omar stopped by to install it. The furnace was back up and running no more than 24 hours after Frank took a first look at it.

Very impressed with the service, their knowledge and how quickly they were able to identify and resolve the issue. Above all, we value their honesty and have trusts in their recommendations. We will be using their service for all of our cooling and heating services for our home.; Best repair experience ever! The technician clarified the issue with my heater, and he strolled me through the causes and required repairs. He was staggeringly educated, and he even shared some maintenance tips and showed them just for me. He didn't attempt to convince me to replace our heater when I got some information about it.

He is straightforward and simply an exquisite individual. I can't recommend this company enough.

They go above and beyond to repair what you have before making any recommendations to replace. Even when I ask if I should upgrade something they will be honest and tell us when something isn’t necessary.

As most homes in NJ were, our home was impacted by the recent Hurricane Ida storm and our water heater, sump pumps and bathtub drain all needed to be looked at, each for different reasons. The tech who came out, took care of all three and worked up a sweat to help get our water heater working again. He resolved all three of our issues and concerns on the same day and I couldn’t be more grateful to this company for consistently coming through with successful repairs. I happily recommend this company to anyone in Bergen county.; Simple exceptional outstanding customer service. Was able to diagnose and return with the proper part within the same day I called.I would not hesitate to call again for future needs..; Very reliable & dependable service. Office support staff’s terrific as well as the two technicians Jimmy & Pete. Will always call them first!; Tim has done lots of work in our home and every experience has been excellent.  We would recommend him and his crew for any plumbing or heating job.  Just called for an emergency and they called back within 2 minutes.  Problem under control."
ChIJ469Dn_j7wokR-COQNx6skZ8,Tommys Plumbing & Heating LLC,"69 W Midland Ave, Paramus, NJ 07652",3.8,16,,N/A,"I do not recommend this plumbing & heating service. I had a boiler that was installed two years ago by another company that shut down and was told they had sold or given their equipment to Tommys.  My boiler stopped working several days ago. I called Tommys and they came to take a look. First visit I was told there was a ""loose connection"" and that it was fixed. After they left, the boiler stopped working again.  They came back again and told me they had missed another ""loose connection"" and fixed it.  They left and it stopped working again.  When they came back they told me the system was just heating the water tank first due to priority and was working again.  After they left it stopped working. They came back the following day with a different employee. He looked at the boiler for a while and told me it was either the pressure of the gas supply or the gas valve had to be replaced.  He told me to call the gas company to check the pressure.  The gas company came later that evening and told me the pressure was fine and that none of the diagnostic claims of Tommys staff were true.  I left another message for Tommys and never heard back.  I have two young kids and they left us without heat and hot water and in general are hard to reach. You have to go through an answering service and call multiple times to get a response.  So in summary, my experience with them has been that they are unable to diagnose issues with a boiler and do not appropriately prioritize the issue based on how hard they are to reach despite advertising themselves as a 24 hour service. I am very disappointed and feel like I wasted my money only to have resolution of this issue delayed several days. Maybe all of this is a one-off for them or my boiler has a particularly hard to diagnose issue. But at this time, I can only give them one star based on the quality of my experience in terms of competence and customer service/prioritization.

Update: I am dumbfounded by the company's response to my review.  Not sure what they mean by me being cheap or expecting it to be under warranty.  They charged me about $400 for the first visit.  I was not charged for the 3 follow up visits as the issue was not resolved which I think was appropriate. There were no new parts installed. I asked them if anything was covered under warranty and they said no which I accepted. Anyway, I felt I had to clarify based on the really disingenuous response.  Like I said, my issue was never resolved and they never followed up.  They never told me they had decided to stop working with me. Last I heard, they said to contact them if the gas company said there was no pressure issue and they would replace the valve itself (with the gas company says is not the issue).  Anyway, I like to support local businesses and I gave the prior plumber who installed the boiler a stellar review.  I have no idea if there was an issue with installation.  So it is true this company did not install the boiler and should not be blamed for any installation issues.  Happy to discuss with the owner and edit my review if he thinks it is unfair.; Tommy and his crew could not have been more professional, always on time and very friendly.
They did an excellent job of installing a whole new air conditioning system, new furnace, and corrected a previous plumbers mistakes when he installed our hot water tank. Neat, clean, timely and excellent work ethic. Tommy went over and above to help us out of problems we were having with other less reputable companies. Would highly recommend Tommys Plumbing & Heating!; Have tried to use Tommy’s service several times.

Service one was for a furnace issue where they claimed to have fixed the issue on their first visit, but had to come back only a week later to fix it again. The second tech claimed that the work that was stated to be complete the first time was not done. After the second service my furnace has been working perfectly.

Second was for an air conditioner service appointment. They have simply not returned any of my calls to get the work complete. Disappointing and frustrating customer service.; We purchased a new refrigerator and had the company that we purchased from add a water line that tied into our existing water line for the icemaker - the new valve leaked a lot.  After two unsuccessful attempts to fix it, w contacted Tommy's 24/7 emergency line for assistance.  They were polite, professional and prompt.  After fixing the issue with a new valve, Tommy explained the issue and charged us a reasonable amount for his time and expertise.  They even cleaned up the mess that the leaky valve caused.  No leaks since. Tommy and Son are our plumbers of choice - thank you!; Can’t say enough good things about this service. The handymen are fast and friendly. Additionally, the service is reliable. We’ve even called Tommy’s plumbing to fix jobs done by other companies. Another company performed maintenance on our furnace. As a result, there was a gas leak. We called Tommy’s emergency line and they were over right away to fix the problem, and we haven't had a gas leak since. Additionally, a houseguest had accidentally flushed a small bottle of deodorizer down the toilet that we could not dislodge ourselves. Tommy’s service was over within an hour and in about 1 hour’s time the clog was removed.","I do not recommend this plumbing & heating service.

We used him for multiple utility related projects/installations and I couldn't be happier with the quality of the work.  Rick is also extremely honest and without going into details, was fair in his assessments of other quotes I showed him from competitors (that is, he acknowledged when competitors gave reasonable quotes).  He is not pushy and seems to actually care about his customer's satisfaction and needs.  I would not hesitate to use his company's services again.  Thank you, Rick, for a great experience.; Came home very late from being away to no heat. Called Rick around 7am and he had his guys here within an hour.

I needed a new furnace in my house. Not a small job.
I called friends and family to get recommendations, called few companies but couldn’t find someone to do it immediately.
I’ve found Black Dog Plumbing online and  spoke to Rick.
Rick came to estimate the work, gave me a FAIR price wich I agreed to. A bit of a risk but I had a good feeling about it and I wasn’t wrong!!
Job was done in no time and it’s working great!
The new furnace is so efficient My gas bill dropped by 15%!
I feel lucky getting to know Rick and wife and would recommend to anyone who need Plumbing/heating services.
You can’t go wrong with these people!!!; My family and I have been using Rick and Blackdog for the past 10 years and we won’t consider ever using anyone else. Last night (Friday, August 13), in the midst of a heat wave, our AC stopped working. It is a system that Rick and Blackdog had installed within the past 24 months.

I called Rick at 8:30pm and left a message. Although it was hot, it certainly was an emergency. I didn’t expect him to get back to me until Monday at the earliest.

By 10:00am, I had a tech on site and by 11:00am, my central air was up and running.

ChIJY3LCbhHtwokRGBqAo2XULIw,Mr. Rooter Plumbing of Westchester NY,"430 Nepperhan Ave, Yonkers, NY 10702",3.7,6,,N/A,"Had an emergency drainage issue over the holiday weekend. Called Mr.Rooter and spoke with some answering service.
They took down my information and told me I would be contacted shortly. I waited 4 to 5 hours and never heard back. Placed a second call with the same results. Finally i called another drainage service (Westchester drain solutions).
They responded promptly and solved the issue rather quickly.
No one ever contacted me back from Mr. Rooter, very unreliable.
Do yourself a favor and avoid Mr. Rooter.; If I could give negative 500 stars I would. We had our toilet serviced in Dec 2022 because our toilet was leaking from the sides. Although the plumber, Jimmy, fixed it - he actually made the problem worse. The wax ring he installed was not installed well and the water instead LEAKED THROUGH OUR CEILING to downstairs. Thus, now we have to replace our whole kitchen ceiling, replace our HVAC Insulation, and possibly tens of thousands of dollars to repair the impacted materials. I am so disappointed and hope you never have to go through the same situation. This all could be avoided if the plumber actually did his job.; The office staff was very helpful! Elizabeth and Isabel were 10/10! Jimmy was the plumber that came to my house, he was extremely knowledgeable! Would recommend to family and friends!; My experience with them was excellent.

We had a blocked up drain and were not able to use any of our bathroom showers or sinks as waste water would back up and flood our basement bathroom floor.  I called them first thing this morning at 8:15 am.  They were at my home about 1 hour later and snaked out the main waste line and other drains problem solved by 10:00 am.; Shout out to Maccarone.  Had a leaky pipe in basement.  Crew came by in 2 hours.  Meticulous in opening the wall ,fixing pipe and other necessary work.  Can't ask for better service. We are repeat customers and will only use Maccarone! Quality all the way; If I could give negative stars, I would. The guy came in, started looking at the pipe, and decided to pump water pressure to treat clogged pipes. Long story short, not only it did not work, but because of the method he used, the pipes burst in the basement (and the basement got at least an inch of water). Instead of helping get the water out, he just kept on going in and out of the flooded basement like nothing happened while I was rushing with the towels. At the end, after multiple attempts and multiple times I asked to him to do so, he decided to use to snake to clear the pipes. To make me feel better, he said he would not charge me for the overtime he worked/destroyed my basement.

Two days later I called the office and explained the situation, they first offered me $100 discount!!! They also mentioned that the methods used were acceptable but not the best thing to do in these cases...so my question is ‘why would someone come into anyone’s house to do a job, and do something that is not the best thing to do?’

When I told them I am not paying, they finally offered for someone to come back and inspect. When the ops supervisor came in, he said they had instructed everyone not to use the pressure thing anymore. The supervisor said they would not charge and will come back to clean and fix the damage. A week later, the charge mysteriously appeared on my statement, I contacted the supervisor I had spoken to, he replied back he would look into it, and since then not a word from them. I tried calling, texting. Nothing! The most unprofessional people I have ever dealt with. I would never recommend them, never! Unless you want to spend money fixing your house afterwards.; This is a very clear review.  I had a condensate leak with my AC.  I was a little nervous to investigate it myself, despite that I'm handy.  We are in high heat August.  I met a tech at a supply house.  I called the shop.  Rosie was polite and mostly clear.  I was told I'd be paying time and a half.  I thought I would pay the service fee and each half hour.
I took apart the unit myself.  The tech blew out a line. He was at my house for 23 minutes and left before 5 pm.

Our AC unit is around 15 years old. It uses R22 refrigerant, which is quite expensive. I was receiving some ridiculous prices for a few pounds of the refrigerant. This company gave me a price which was still expensive, but much less than others.

We got our Freon recharge, but the technician revealed that the unit is leaking the refrigerant very slowly. Soon we will run out of Freons, again. He also told us that R22 will be eradicated from the entire world by 2020. We will have a new unit installed soon, but right now we have to make do with the old unit.; We switched on our furnace for the first time this season as the weather is getting colder by day.

These guys got me an early appointment and sent a technician at the scheduled time. He diagnosed the unit and fixed it within thirty minutes. Great work and polite customer service. I highly recommend them.; I have to say I am genuinely impressed with this service. These guys are very skillful and honest.

Our AC unit is around 15 years old. It uses R22 refrigerant, which is quite expensive. I was receiving some ridiculous prices for a few pounds of the refrigerant. This company gave me a price which was still expensive, but much less than others.

We got our Freon recharge, but the technician revealed that the unit is leaking the refrigerant very slowly. Soon we will run out of Freons, again. He also told us that R22 will be eradicated from the entire world by 2020. We will have a new unit installed soon, but right now we have to make do with the old unit.; We recently moved the location of our salon. Water is super important at a hair salon (obviously) and everything that could have gone wrong did. We were able to reach the plumber who did our previous work (and we learned later used a lot of used parts -_-) and so we were recommended to this plumbers. They came right out (and we used them two more times) and they fixed the issues, were really pleasant, and didn't charge us anything ridiculous. I'm impressed.

I had roots in my Main Line for years. The main would typically get stuck on Saturday, when finding someone to take care of it is a challenging task. I am lucky I found Steven - the Ray Rooter guy.

Important: Steven worked with my homeowner Insurance to make sure they have all the claim information they needed.

Day one was thorough clean up - they used their modern equipment to clean the pipe inside. Day two - they showed up really early and installed the liner. They stayed until the liner cured and run multiple video inspections throughout the process.

Another thorough video inspection before they left, and I now have a root free main!

He took the time to explain everything to me in simple to understand terms.
I knew exactly what to expect and knew the total cost before he started the work. No surprises. No stress.
I am very pleased with the entire Team experience.; Team Electric responded to my plumbing emergency.  James S provided super service and did the emergency repair to correct a main sewer line pipe break in my crawlspace.  He keep us informed about the work and his work was exemplary.  The team at Team Electric are truly professional, courteous and a quality company.; I want to tell you guys a little story about good customer service.

A few days ago I asked if anyone knows plumbers because my mom's house needed one ASAP. My friend got in touch with me and told me that his company Team Electric, Plumbing & Air is available 24/7. Working with them was SUPER effortless. I called, they set an appointment. Texted me to confirm, showed up the next day AND charged a more than fair price.

My pipes are frozen at MY house now. So who did I call? Team Electric, Plumbing & Air! The person that picked up already knew who I was, how to spell my name (it is super long haha) and in no time she scheduled an appointment for me.

I love their customer service team and their plumbers are awesome as well. Will always use their service from now on!!!; My Attic fan was bad so I asked my neighbor who he used and he recommended Team Electric Plumbing and Air. John answered the phone and we made plans for him to come over in a couple of days. I have a very steep pitch roof on my house and John was in and out in one hour after diagnosing that it wasn't the thermostat, but that the fan was burned out. The price was fair, but the service was very prompt and we're enjoying our new attic fan.","Came out to tell me what I already knew.  Then quoted me 1000.00 plus tax usd to run 8 ft wire to a door bell. 👍 ok save your time and money.

Javier, owner of Kane Plumbing, always come through for us and is very reliable. I am the Board President and highly recommend Kane Plumbing.; I recently had a water line run to my fridge by Javier from Kane Plumbing.  Kane was the only one who wanted to come by to give me an accurate estimate opposed to everyone who wanted to charge an exorbitant amount or quote over the phone which resulted in an inflated quote with the possibility of tacking on additional charges due to ""unforeseen circumstances"".

I strongly recommend this company if you was competitive pricing as well as someone who is very punctual. Javier was on time for his estimate and the job.  After finishing the job, he cleaned up everything and walked me through what he did.  I would use Kane again in a heartbeat.; Javier did an excellent job installing a utility sink in my laundry room. He kept all his appointments, provided a fair estimate, and went above and beyond to make sure the job was done right (he drove out to get the right part instead of doing a workaround).

My parents' old residence renovated, replaced 90% of plumbing and piping, and installed all new fixtures for 3 baths.  During the installation, Mejia plumbing displayed mind-bogglingly disorganized procedure - they opened up parts for all the fixtures in the same room at the same time and mixed them up.  They
lost valuable shower parts, as well as the chrome trough drain cover (around $400), butchered the vanities, set the suspended toilet seat above 20"" (comfortable for giants), and set shower head at 5 feet (comfortable for the small children) and then thought it was OK.  I have photographs for all of this (and more).   Also, if you ever expect a call-back, your great grandchildren will be graduating college before that happens; I will never recommend this contractor.; Very professional and helpful","Very professional and helpful; Would honestly give zero stars if I could.

I literally could not have gotten through the experience with Chaim. They had to retrace the house not knowing how the pipes ran which way or that. He did the work with as little demo as possible and he and his men were amazing and fixed all areas.  I have come to rely on him and he's always very responsive and does very good work.; Honestly, I wouldn’t even give them a one star but I didn’t have a choice according to my choices! I spent almost $20,000 in a whole new system and it’s terrible it’s 22° outside and my heat fell down to 49° and they told me they’re doing me a favor if they come over And help… I’m sick and my mother is 86 years old. I end up disassembling my brand new furnace and igniting the burners myself because they would not respond and they told me I’d be $500 if they come over. I can’t afford it…  Anyway I didn’t blow myself up! Thank God, but don’t ever hire these people you, you will regret that! Spend a little more and someone who knows what they’re doing. Not only that somebody that will actually respond and help! This is pathetic.; I deal with professionals all the time for both business and my home. I rarely give reviews, but my experience with Chaim Cohen could not have been better. They are responsive, fair in pricing, and their work was excellent. They also left the workspace immaculate. I had them do a project for one of my businesses, and they not only handled the work flawlessly, they actually saved us money by simplifying the job and lowered the cost by over 30%. Not sure why others have had issues. Maybe there was a clash of personalities?; Never hire them. They are irresponsible, rude and everything else. They came to change my thermostat and two weeks later both heating and cooling system started at the same time. I called them with the issue and never came or took responsibility over a bad job. I had to call another technician and told me theat they did a horrible installation, they messed up the wires both wires, heating and cooling were touching.; Treats his employees like dirt and he's unscrupulous he's also a putz!
