After looking for a reliable company on yelp I decided on New Generation plumbing.  I put the call in at 6:30pm and it was answered quickly by Jake who set me up with a free estimate the next morning (they would have gone same day but I requested the morning).   With out having to reach out to confirm this morning, I had Fernando call me (ahead of schedule) that he was there.  He walked me through the work that would be needed as well as potential scenarios if original assessment needed further work.   Once he got the unit working he called me again to tell me what was done to it.   Also informed me of yearly maintenance that will be needed and would send me a reminder. Which I appreciate.  Price is reasonable, Will be using them again.   Overall very reliable, great customer service, will be using them again; My insurance company asked me to install an automatic gas shutoff valve. I began looking through yelp and found Martin at New Generation Plumbing! His price was the best and he could also do the job the next morning. He finished the job very quickly and it looks great! I highly encourage everyone to check out New Generation Plumbing (ask for Martin) as you will get great quality work at reasonable prices.; As homeowners, we dread when something goes wrong with our house … new generation and Fernando have made every experience so easy and stress free. Hes always available, responsive, listens to every concern … informative. Love this company and have recommended them to everyone in our neighborhood and will continue to do so. Thanks guys.; Jake and Jose were incredibly thorough and efficient. We had to replace old sewer lines and fix several other plumbing issues. Not only did they do a great job, but they also left our home as clean as possible while and after they worked. Highly recommend this team.; I have a tankless water heater that wasn't producing hot water. I called Fernando at New Generation and he came over and fixed a valve, but when it continued to not work (it was old) they very quickly installed a new heater. They were great to work with and clearly explained everything they were doing!"

Victor was very nice and quick gave great advice. They were able to quote me over the phone, they quoted me less than half of what other plumbers were quoting me because others were charging an after hours fee. After the job was done the price they quoted on the phone was what I paid.

They said theyre open 24/7. I would hire them again.; I had a great experience with John’s Plumbing & Drain Services. They were able to schedule an appointment for the very next day, which I greatly appreciated.

The technician arrived right on time and was incredibly professional.

The customer service from the office staff was excellent as well—they were friendly and kept me informed throughout the process. I felt valued as a customer.

I’ll definitely be calling them for any future plumbing needs.; John’s Plumbing came the same day I called. They waited until the baby woke from a nap so he wasn’t woken up then did the job quickly. They cleared a toilet drain pipe. Pricing was reasonable and the receptionist/office was quick and courteous. I’m giving 5 stars.; I recently had the pleasure of using John’s Plumbing for a plumbing issue at my home, and I was thoroughly impressed with the entire experience. From start to finish, the service was exceptional.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the service provided by John’s plumbing. They exceeded my expectations, and I will definitely be using them for any future plumbing needs. Highly recommend!; I had an urgent plumbing issue with a clogged toilet on a Sunday night, and Vic was a lifesaver! He showed up promptly at 9pm, exactly when I needed him the most.

Ask for Mike, he’s been there since 2007. He came within a few hours of the request, knew what the problem was right away, gave a quote to replace the seal while also warning that the plastic component had a tendency of breaking during removal and gave a quote for that in the event it happened, which it didn’t. Overall, super satisfied and thrilled to find a new and awesome plumbing company for any future needs.; I am very pleased with the replacement of the Water Pressure Regulator Valve (PRV) installed by Ruben at my family rental property in LA.  The workmanship was excellent.  Ruben and Charles explained that due to the city water pressure of 120 psi, the original PRV likely failed because it was a builder grade that contained plastic parts.  Ruben  installed a superior quality, dual piston PRV that does not contain any plastic components.  I will definitely use Red Lilly Plumbing for future plumbing repairs and upgrades.."

Technician Fernando provided an outrageous estimate of $15,000 for a plumbing repair that turned out to be a very simple fix. He didn’t even attempt to undo the faucet to properly assess the situation. Instead, it is clear that he was attempting to take advantage of me as a female homeowner by providing a grossly inflated and fraudulent estimate. After seeking a second opinion, the issue was resolved quickly for less than a fraction of the price quoted by Fernando.

This experience has left me feeling both disappointed and taken advantage of. I expected better from a company I’ve relied on for years. Unfortunately, I will no longer be using your services moving forward.; Ignacio was extremely helpful and easy to work with throughout the process. Ignacio was punctual, consistently showing up on time, and provided a range of options to ensure the work met my needs.; Manny was a great technician. I texted him last minute about a plumbing issue and he showed up that same day within 45min. The service was quick and easy and he made sure to explain everything clearly to me. I highly recommend Roto-Rooter for any plumbing and pipe issue with mainline and clogs. I was very happy with the customer service, speedy response time, and will surely use this company in the future.; Called the same day and had someone there within two hours.
But when you call, ask for Jonathan Lopez. If you don’t ask for him then what are you doing? Haha
Came right away with a great attitude and got everything done so quick.
10/10 will definitely call back in the future; Joe was great. He was early, started on time, took care of the issues without a hassle, took time to explain to me exactly what the issue were, the recommendations.   Very professional and thorough, extremely satisfied"

Will definitely use this company again if needed!; I have used Mr. Rooter for several years and the technicians has always been nice & friendly. Mr. Albert Rodriguez/technician has serviced my house twice within a 2 wk period.  He was very friendly and knowledgeable about plumbing and my situation in general. I will recommend Mr. Rooter and technician Mr Rodriguez to anyone who needs plumbing work done.; My service technician was Christian Carroll.  He was wonderful, punctual and professional. I appreciate the extra time he took to help solve my plumbing problem and was patient enough to explain it to me in layman terms. He provided me a reasonable rate for the service and got the job done in under an hour!  Would definitely call on him again for any future plumbing issues; We had a main water replaced (big job) and Andy was very thorough atlooking a the various options given us options to minimizing any brick or concrete work.  He was great about explaining all the details and changes that were necessary to complete the job.  Recommend Mr. Rooter; The folks at Mr. Rooter are knowledgeable, efficient and friendly. What I especially appreciate is their effective method of communication. I was contacted the day of their service to confirm the time of arrival, and the plumber arrived right on time. Also, I was emailed my invoice as promised. I highly recommend."

Prior to start of job proper estimates were given for my approval.
Once approved he did a good job on time. I will highly recommend him and his company to all customers.; ️I had an outstanding experience with Brendon. He not only fixed the issue we called him for, but he also went out of his way to check other potential problems and ensure everything was working perfectly before leaving. His attention to detail and thoroughness were impressive. On top of that, his pricing was more than fair, and he clearly values providing excellent service at a great price. He was punctual, professional, and genuinely committed to doing quality work. I highly recommend Brendon for anyone in need of a reliable, trustworthy plumber!; Dimitri came out to diagnose our situation, and we decided to install a new water softener.

Derek did an outstanding job and has fabulous customer service skills. He explained everything in detail about getting our new kitchen faucet.

Thank you for outstanding customer service. We will definitely recommend Do it Right Plumbers to our friends.; Do it right plumbers, don't trust them. They installed a water softer for me and it worked for a couple of months. They were not able to fix the unit. After four months waiting for them to respond and remove the unit they refused.

They quickly responded to my calls, arrived on time, and dealt with the issue with care and detail. I felt confident in their skill and professionalism, and I would n't hesitate to call them again. I highly recommend!; I had an emergency early this morning. Called A1, spoke to Vincent who was great. Then Ron and Dominique came and diagnosed the problem. They did a temporary fix to tide me over until tomorrow morning. I’ll give an update then. Super nice people. Maybe a little expensive, but it was an emergency situation.

Update: the next day, German and Sebastian came to install a new water heater, piping etc. they text you when they’re on their way, and there’s an app showing you where they are. I thought that was hilarious for some reason, probably unnecessary, but great anyway. German and Sebastian were very friendly, and I think read the room well: I was freaking out, they were super polite and supportive. German did most of the work, I think Sebastian was basically apprenticing. They installed everything, and German pointed out some issues with my plumbing, which I knew about, but he explained it in a really clear way. They really were awesome, and these guys are my new plumbers, which hopefully I’ll never need again, but you never know.

They also have a repair service who will do a small job for me on Monday. I’ll add to this review after that, but I expect they’ll be great.; The entire plumbing save the day was for me when I had a plumbing emergency.

We knew it needed to be snaked. Chris was on time, super nice and efficiently snaked the shower drain that had SO MUCH HAIR, would have been difficult to do on our own. Price was also extremely reasonable, significantly less than the company that our HOA recommended. Will DEFINITELY use Chris with Cali for next job!; Simply the best. Our experience in working with Cali Rooter was top notch from start to finish.  We had a crack in our main line, which called for an excavation of the sidewalk and digging a hole 7ft down to reach the main line.  They completed the job in 5 hours and very professional in all aspects of the job.  Highly recommended!  Thanks Cali Rooter!; Bathroom sink started leaking where the drain connects to the bowl. I couldn't figure it out but got a referral from a friend.

Great service. Called and they had someone there fast. Quick, easy, worked very clean, no up sell -- used existing parts and just fixed the issue. He knew what he was doing. Appreciated that he took the time to clean up and during the work was wiping off surfaces that got messy.

Price was fair -- not the cheapest, but not expensive, reasonable to me for the speed and quality of the work.

Got to chatting and it is a full family business, which I love supporting. I'll use them again, that's the highest endorsement.; I have used Cali Rooter and Plumbing twice and have received excellent and prompt service both times. They did the work for about 40% less than the other companies that gave me quotes. Very professional and well-run company and Chris the plumber who did the work was great. They also were able to send someone within an hour of me calling.; Quick, same-day service for a kitchen clog, with clear description of the problem and a fast resolution. John answered all our questions and was very pleasant to work with. Will definitely be a return customer whenever we have plumbing needs."
ChIJ_21GqDm6woARqfzdqwxK51k,Plumber 2 The Rescue,"3871 Huron Ave, Culver City, CA 90232",4.9,351,,N/A,"I scheduled an appointment for 3pm-5pm. Around 4:40pm, I called to try and confirm that a plumber would still be coming. Nobody picked up the phone. It is now over an hour after 5pm and I have not received any calls or information from anyone. Still, nobody is answering the phone. I find the no call/no show to be very unprofessional, and I will take my business elsewhere.; Edwin is friendly, professional, detail-oriented and fast. He did a great job today replacing all the drain pipes under my double-basin kitchen sink. I've used Plumber 2 The Rescue for ten years now, and they are always the best!; Personally, George was a great guy. In terms of the plumbing repair experience, this was not a great one. Some of the issues were because the shutoff valves weren't working as intended, which led to extra difficulty in getting a valve replaced, but some of the issues were avoidable and signs of poor planning and business practices that, while standard in the industry, don't value the customer as much as making more money.

Despite having a picture of the valve that they needed to repair or replace before coming, the plumber took 2 trips to supply stores to get parts. This means that they spent 2-3 hours just driving to get supplies that they could have prepared ahead of time. Of course, they billed me for that time in addition to jacking up the price of the materials by 40% for extra charges of $300-$400. This could have easily been avoided with better planning. All they had to do was ask for some better pictures of the valve if they needed them or ask me to buy my own replacement.

While increasing prices of replacement parts is common, I've also had plumbers that focus on charging for their labor and skill only and either give me the option to buy my own parts or just ask for reimbursements for parts. Contractors that try to earn money on both parts and labor are far more likely to recommend parts that aren't needed or are more expensive since it's in their best interest to do that and earn more money. Plumbers that just charge for their skill and labor tend to be more honest.

I also ended up pulling out a clothes washer on my own and using a half dozen towels to clean water they got all over the floor because they didn't properly prepare the area they were working in. The water not shutting off properly wasn't the plumber's fault, but not being adequately prepared in case there was leaking water was something that could have been done better.

Would I use them again? Maybe, but probably not. I've had enough good contractors to know that there are better options out there than Plumber 2 the Rescue.; I was very impressed with the quality of service I received from this plumbing company. This plumbing service is top-notch! Their prices are fair, and they do great work. The plumber who came to my home was friendly and explained everything he was doing, which made me feel at ease.; Very pleasant experience.
Britney: very kind, pleasant, professional costumer service. Scheduled the appointment pretty much right away,, and the service was done within 2 hours of my initial phone call. Super fast!
George was very professional, experienced, works fast, gave honest and useful advices to me. Very kind.
I will definitely call this company again soon, for vanity installation, and in the future they will be my “go to” place. Honest nice people, prompt service, very reasonable prices upfront, no hidden fees."

We hired this company to repair a very old pipe system in our Condo which required creative thinking and skills. The multiple repairs were accomplished in record time and for a reasonable price. We will be working with this company as a preferred contractor for both individual units and general issues related to the building.; I contacted Carlos to help with a full repipe job in a rental property. After receiving multiple quotes ranging from smaller businesses to the larger plumbing companies, we decided to go with Carlos due to his responsiveness and reasonable pricing. He was very communicative during the whole process, punctual and reliable. He also sent me video and pictures of the completed job, as I was not on-site, and he understood this was important to keep for our rental records. It is always challenging to do major repairs, specially when you are trying to be as least disruptive as possible to occupants, but I am thankful that Carlos and his crew did a great job, all while being considerate to the tenants. I look forward to working with him again in the future.; I have a 1936 Spanish house with original plumbing still in tact (for the most part).  My shower broke and several plumbers told me we were going to have to knock out a wall (which would have required a huge, pricey paint job afterwards, not just a local fix).  Carlos figured out a way to fix it without damaging the walls or the vintage tiles.  He was punctual, courteous and reasonably priced. I've been looking for a good plumber for a while ... and he's it.  I recommend him highly.; I first contacted Carlos in November of last year to help me with a outdoor drainage project at a new build.  The previous contractor fouled the project up and then told me it was my problem.

Carlos was responsive, prompt, professional, and pleasant.  I had to put the project on hold, but 7 months later, when I contacted Carlos again, he picked right up on the project, making telephone calls to the city as needed, and following up with me at least daily.

I ran into some complications, and had to put Carlos on hold again, but a few weeks later when I was ready to go, Carlos was by my side, patiently helping me work through the complications.  He came up with a great resolution, but he coordinated with several people to make it happen, removing that burden from me.

I am creating a list of contractors for my use in the future, and for referral purposes.  Carlos is at the top of the list.  I look forward to working on other projects with Carlos.

By the way, I love Carlos' ""can-do"" attitude and his sincerity.  When he calls people on the phone, he always gives them a brief, but very nice greeting before he gets to the reason for his call. So nice.; Had trouble finding contractor to install water leak detection sensor. I stumbled upon Carlos thru Google search and very happy in connecting with him. Carlos was great and reasonably priced. He followed up to schedule the job.once I had the part. The installation was smooth and fast. I would highly recommend."

From Nancy who took my original call and Alvin the supervisor I was impressed with their professionalism.  They dealt with me and coordinated with my tenants to get the job done.

Jackie came over on a same-day call on a Sunday, much appreciated!

Customer service was excellent on the phone. I asked for a quote if I sent an image over, she said no per Company standards. Okay, no problem, just need estimate $ so I can compare time ✅ and cost 👎🏼

The negative part was this cost me out-of-pocket $150, versus another company who was going to charge $50 just to evaluate AND do the job at that price if I waited another hour. Cost-wise: not fully recommended; timeliness and customer service: highly recommended.

I expected somewhere around $70-$90, but DEFINITELY not $150.; Rudy was absolutely skilled, professional, friendly and neat. Let the area cleaner than what it was before he showed up. I used this plumbing service before and will continue to use them at my house and I highly recommend them.; Rudy’s performance was thumbs up. He had only one thing on his mind when he arrived at my place to solve the problem.

God Bless, Diane; I made an appointment for an estimate to install a Comfort System on a hot water heater. I picked Prodigy Plumbing because of their great reviews, which were spot on. Steve was their estimator and was professional, friendly and honest to a fault. He was very informative and thorough, explaining our options with his best intentions for our decision making. This is incredibly rare in my experience, where most contractors mimic used car salesman in their selling tactics. I was looking for an honest, professional and ethical plumbing company and Prodigy Plumbing is my go too from now on.; Great customer service! They were responsive and came out to diagnose my issue. After a thorough evaluation which included a check under the house, I was presented with a solution and given a choice of prices to choose from.

I would recommend them.; Upon a friend’s referral, I called Prodigy Plumbing.  They sent Jerry Navarro to fix the plumbing problems in my home. He did an amazing job! He was able to fix one of the problems that two other previous plumbers couldn’t resolve. He can assess the situation and give options available to the homeowner. I believe he is very honest and therefore trust his opinions. He is professional yet friendly, works to please the customer, and, as I said, did an amazing job! He is an experienced and competent plumber. I also appreciated that he was always on time, reliable, respectful, and left my home as clean as when he arrived. I will call Prodigy Plumbing and ask for Jerry Navarro for my next plumbing needs.  Thank you, Prodigy and Jerry!; I had seen in the local Grunion Gazette that Prodigy Plumbing was voted best plumbing company so I decided to call them when I had some plumbing issues arise.  I can say there's a reason why Prodigy plumbing is voted best in Long Beach!   I've used them twice now and they are a great, honest, local company.  Their plumbers are super friendly and most importantly they are genuinely good and honest people!  Today I had Jerry and Chris come out for a bathroom issue.  I called at 8:30 on a Friday morning.  I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to get someone out the same day and the weekend was just around the corner.  But luckily they were able to send someone and although I was given a 4 hour window, Jerry and Chris were at my door within the hour!

We used to have very frequent clogging issues to a point we could not clear the pipe any more. We called GR Pluming for emergency help. Gonsalo contacted me in a few minutes after I contacted their office to schedule an appointment to come over to check. He showed up as he was scheduled. We thought our pipes were just filled up with heavy grease and oil, however we learned we had more serious plumbing issues (main and other sewer lines needs to be replaced) then we thought from Gonsalo’s inspections. Although Gonsalo knew it was challenging to fix it, he worked with us and found the best solutions for us. At the same time, his team are well-trained and very professional. They have professional plumbing equipments, including but not limited to different size of sewer line cameras and high power Hydro Jetting.

I highly recommend Gonsalo and his team for any professional plumbing work. They are very knowledgeable in their line of work. Again, Thank you so much for this professional team to make our nightmare plumbing issues go away.; To who it may concern,
To start, there is no moss under this teams feet. When they start, there is a whole team non-stop working until the job is done.
Plus, at the end of the day we had all water and waste line services up and running.
Even though they changed out almost all the complete water  and waste lines in our house.
They site protected and plastic off the entire area of work and then patch and plastered the holes after plumbing replacement was complete.
Highly recommend GR plumbing and their team to do your plumbing and rooter needs.

During the service, they showed us photos of the areas we cannot see to make sure we know where the damages and future potential damages are. After the service was complete, they made sure to clean every piece of the mess which is not common for most companies who do their job and leave the mess. Thank you guys for being the best!; The plumber who came within a few hours of my problem was knowledgeable about the sprinkler problem I was having. He fully diagnosed the problem and made proper recommendation for replacement equipment.; The technician is nice however we are not agree upon the price.

We had our hot water heater relocated to the outside of our garage and they did a fantastic job from start to finish. They showed up on time, got right to work, and completed the job in a few hours. The work was extremely well done and very neat. We will definitely use Valencia’s Plumbing again and would recommend them to anyone looking for honest work at a fair price.  Thanks again Carlos!; I can’t thank Valencia’s Plumbing enough for all the work they did on my property. They were super fast and reliable. I had sewer issues, they ran the snake and turned out I had tree roots in the pipes. After running the camera and diagnosing they recommended all I needed for me to not have further issues. They had to dig over 5feet and repaired the pipe and added a clean out and also a liner to protect my pipes since they were already damaging. Their prices were very reasonable. Carlos and Jose were the best people to depend on and they worked super quick. Being a landlord and having tenants is not easy, it is our responsibility to have proper bathroom usage. The best part is that they were able to do it without having to get permits  for this to run quick. Thank you Valencia’s plumbing.; I called Valencia's plumbing after the gas tech was unable to get the water heater started, he suggested I contact a plumber and I'm glad I found them. They came out and got it going within 5min, wouldn't take any payment for the service and gave me a good estimate on installing a Moen flo. Would highly recommend them and ill definitely be contacting them again for plumbing needs 👍; I can’t say enough about the incredibly fast response time and professionalism of Christian and the team. We had a leak where the cast iron pipes from our house met the clay pipes from the city and now have peace of mind with the repair. Throughout the job, we were provided updates on progress and informed on the materials used. Will happily return for more business. Thank you, Valencia’s plumbing!"
ChIJpV-x8TuRwoAR7uLmQnagixY,Most Valuable Plumber,"20338 Corisco St, Chatsworth, CA 91311",4.6,327,,N/A,"Sebastian came out from MVP plumbing and did an awesome job. He was well mannered and well dressed. Kind and courteous. Got the sink drain fixed and main thing that others don’t do is he cleaned up wiped down the sink and everything he touched. He cleaned and left everything spotless. Would recommend again and again. And this was the best and lowest rate out of the companies I called for quotes. I hope they keep this rate in this economy for us and if you do go with MVP again ask for Sebastian.; We had a bad smell in the bathroom.  My wife called MVP while I was out of town.  Manny climbed under the house and took a video,(attached).  He said there was sewage everywhere and it was a mess.  They would have to dig out 2 to 3 feet and on the other side of the foundation wall.  Big job.  It would be $5500.

He came back the next day and went to the store, bought parts and fixed everything in 4 hours and 15 minutes.

There was water damage from the bathtub they told my wife about.  So she called a Restoration company.  They were surprised at the repair amount.

I went under and videoed the repairs 6 hours later.  They did replace some abs pipe about 6 feet, and dug out nothing.

I called several Plumbers for other opinions.  I sent them both videos.
""Absolutely ridiculous... 0 digging..you can clearly see new section of pipe connected to existing pipe into ground...
Call bbb
Give them a bad review because they are thieves!!""

I agree and will be calling the BBB.  Videos below

Clarabel has since called me.  She assured me there would be NO CHARGES! She apologized for the whole ordeal.

This is a WOMEN OWNED business.  Remember always get other bids and experts before you spend!; BEWARE of MVP Plumbing's bait-and-switch tactics. I called them for their $33 drain-clearing offer, but the technician said he couldn’t access the clean-out. Instead, he claimed I needed an entire plumbing redo under my sink with a new clean-out for $2,500–$3,000. He then inspected my (non-leaking) drain line and quoted $15,000–$17,000 for a re-drain! This unnecessary inspection cost me $100. The manager even tried to convince me these major repairs were essential.

Thankfully, I got a second opinion from a local, family-run plumber with 23 years of experience. He resolved the issue by snaking the drain from the sink in 20 minutes—for $200 with a 30-day guarantee. With the holidays coming, I'm relieved I avoided MVP Plumbing's upsell and kept my budget intact. I recommend sticking with small, honest local companies that won’t pressure you into unneeded, costly repairs.; Expert work and service. Great bedside manner. Flexible with pricing on big jobs. They did a full replacement of our ancient clay pipe sewer line and worked quickly to get it done with a great warranty as well. Recommend.; It started as an after hours main sewer line back up into two bathrooms and a shower in my home.  MVP came to my home within two hours.  Adam was amazing, kind and honest.  While at my home I asked them to evaluate a potential problem that I was aware of when I bought the home.  Adam and Manny fully evaluated my concern.  It was an issue with the old clay pipe.  They presented me multiple options and did not pressure me into any of them.  I ended up having my entire sewer pipe replaced.  It was not inexpensive but a very fair price based on the scope of the work.  Adam and crew went to work the following day.  Every step of the way I was included.  They were clean and returned my yard back to its original condition. While doing the repairs Adam was even willing to evaluate a few other plumbing issues I had at no charge.  I would highly recommend MVP and I now finally know who I can call when any other plumbing issues come up."

Not only was he able to come today, but his courtesy and professionalism is fantastic. He fixed an issue I had with another plumbing service and gave me things to watch for in the future. I will definitely call him again. He was a blessing. Thank you; Jaime was very nice, did a good job, made sure he addressed all root cause to unclog my restroom.; The guys were very knowledgeable and friendly. Did the work quickly and at a fair price.; This company (or perhaps just the technician they sent out) severely took advantage of my family.

We had a leak on the second floor in the master shower. MID was available for 24-hour emergency service. They came out quickly, found, and stopped the leak.

The shower valve cartridge was bad and needed to be replaced. We were quoted $375 for labor (including the initial visit) plus parts. No problem.

When the same tech came back, he replaced the cartridge and valve. I was at work at the time, so my wife paid him...$1575.00!

The cartridge and hardware were approximately  $200. So the maximum we should have been looking at was around $600. Not nearly three times that cost.

Obviously, if I were there, I would have protested. My wife didn't know about the previously quoted price and just paid it, because she trusted him, as you should be able to from a reputable company.

The techs name is Alfonso. When I called him, he actually laughed off my concerns. He told me that was ""the going rate."" After searching online, the quote range for a shower cartridge replacement ranges from $300-700, which is what his original quote was.

Where did the $1575 come from? I have no idea. He is a crooked man. He took advantage of us in a vulnerable situation. He knew that if he came when I wasn't home, my wife would be more likely to just pay the bill, no questions asked.

The fact that he laughed it off and basically told me ""too bad"" is unbelievable.

By the way, I have the whole work order with the above information and quote in writing. Interestingly, after I had signed the quote, he filled in a separate section with the new amount in the ""authorization of work"" in a different color ink, AFTER the job was done.

If Alfonso is the type of person this company employs, they're willing to steal your money, lie  to you, and forget documents, I highly advise you to look elsewhere.

Do not hire Make It Drain.; Had a kitchen sink back up...Alfonso arrived within the hour...took care of business.  Not only was Alfonso qualified and knowledgable he was one of those exceptional human beings who really was there to help.  He's the guy to ask for if available.  I highly recommend."

So Polite & Respectful! & Super Efficient. He cleaned up after himself & made sure that the under sink area was perfect. I'm just so impressed. Highly Recommend!!; The squad just finished a huge job and actually blown away by the team.

People with amazing social skills, promptness, hard working. Feels like a rare combo in the trades industry.

Edwin was our project manager and initial inspector. He was great in answering questions for a week after the initial estimate and a huge reason we chose Beach Plumbing.  Price was right in the middle of some other quotes we got but felt most comfortable with Beach.

Robert, Richard, and K were the 3 working on our house I believe — and they grinded long days to finish as early as possible for us.  I mostly only spoke with Robert who was just as awesome as Edwin.; I recently had an urgent gas leak issue at my property, prompting the city to shut off our gas supply. In a state of urgency, we reached out to Beach Plumbing, and their response time was outstanding. Within just a couple of hours, they had scheduled an appointment for us.

When Edwin from Beach Plumbing arrived at our house, his promptness and professionalism were immediately apparent. He conducted a thorough inspection to detect the gas leaks, and his attention to detail was commendable. Edwin's dedication to providing top-notch customer service truly stood out. Not only did he address the issue efficiently, but he also went above and beyond our expectations.

His depth of knowledge and friendly demeanor made the entire experience smooth and stress-free. Edwin's commitment to excellence deserves special recognition, and if there were a button to give Beach Plumbing 10 stars, he and the company would certainly deserve it.

Overall, I highly recommend Beach Plumbing for their exceptional service, and Edwin, in particular, for his outstanding professionalism and dedication to customer satisfaction.; The most pleasant on-site plumbing consultation/estimate I’ve ever experienced. Matthew showed up on time, and was so personable and polite. He intently listened to my concerns and patiently answered all my questions. His explanations were so thorough and thoughtful. Though the estimate provided was a bit higher than others, I had no doubt this was because of the quality of workmanship going into the project as well as the guarantee you’d be well cared for as their client both during and after the project was completed. Thanks Matthew, I will definitely keep Beach Plumbing in mind for future projects."

True professional👍🏻 I recommend him and his team 100%; Called John to get a second opinion on an estimate from another company that didn't sound right. He was stunned by the crazy estimate I had gotten from the other company so he came out the same day and took care of the routine maintenance needed on a tankless water heater. He was honest, professional, and incredibly experienced. Next time I have a plumbing issue I know exactly who I'll be calling!; John came over on his day off to help us with our leak. We are not knowledgeable about plumbing at all and we so appreciate his kindness. John Jr. installed our ice maker and was so kind, professional, and quick!  We love this company!; I hired Just Right Plumbing to fix a kitchen sink issue. They said it was fixed. A few years later I find they left the pipe draining into the crawl space. I asked them to fix it. They had the nerve to charge me for the repair. They said they needed to replace all the galvanized pipes with new pipes. Now the plumbing is backing up again. They denied doing the plumbing even though I have an invoice from them that details the work. Again they refuse to fix their faulty work. They are costing me money, time and energy. And John is rude, belittling, and takes advantage of my ignorance on the subject matter. Avoid please. The photo I have is after the first repair - the water was draining down the foundation wall into the crawl space.; I called to set up an appointment. John called me back and said he would be there in  1  1/2 hours. I never heard from him so called him back. He said he was stuck on another job and forgot to call. He would get back to tomorrow.  Never heard from him. Don't waist your time with this company."

He has fixed multiple plumbing issues in my unit and building and always does high quality work. He responds quickly, is very knowledgable, and is always honest and fair about prices and options for fixing issues. I recommend DX Plumbing to anyone in need.; Abraham was terrific. Had clog in lateral sewage pipe. He solved the problem instantly with hydrojet and camera. Trustworthy. Informative. Made himself available right away. And most affordable on top of everything else. Family owned business. Put this one in your contacts.; My next-door neighbor recommended Abraham from DX Plumbing when I told him we were in need of a new plumber. My neighbor said he had found Abraham by doing an extensive Google search and reading lots of reviews.

We have now used Abraham twice: once last month to replace our Insinkerator product, which had stopped working, and to replace the water filters in our sink and fridge.

The second time was a week ago, after our 21-year-old hot water heater died by spraying water all over our sub-basement. Abraham returned my call on a Saturday afternoon and came by my house on a Sunday to assess the situation. He had a new water heater installed on Monday afternoon. While he waited for the delivery, he uninstalled the old one and moved it outside.

With this help, we only had to go a little more than 48 hours with just cold sink water and flushing toilets. After that, our new hot water heater was installed and we were able to shower again and have hot water in all showers and sinks.

I was very grateful for his attentiveness and expediency both times we worked with him.

After I left him a voicemail when the water heater first began leaking, and didn't immediately hear back, I called plumbers recommended by other friends. No one was available on a weekend, except for one guy, who was going to charge me $320/hour. Fortunately, Abraham called me back shortly after and was able to walk me through the next steps.; I have utilized various plumbing services over the years, and my experiences, particularly with plumbing, have never been satisfactory until I started working with Abraham four years ago. Since then, I have consistently had excellent experiences. Abraham's work is truly top-notch, and it is evident that you are paying for quality craftsmanship. Especially when it comes to high-end kitchen and bathroom fixtures, I would trust no one else to handle them. Abraham has successfully completed both large-scale projects and smaller house services for me, demonstrating exceptional skill and professionalism. His attitude is always positive, and his honesty is truly commendable.""; I contacted DX Plumbing for help clearing tree roots from my sewer line. I knew that I had to have major work done on the sewer line but I wasn’t sure who to trust with the job…so I put it on hold for three years. Once I met Abraham, I was 100% sure he was the person to help me. He was upfront, professional, thorough, and on time. He completed the major work for me and I could not be more impressed with his work.
Abraham completed all of the work, was on time, and left the space in better shape than he found it. If you are unsure about contacting DX Plumbing, just do it. You will not regret working with Abraham/DX Plumbing."

Carlos left the work area exactly as he found it - clean! I highly recommend The Family Plumber.*

I called The Family Plumber (April 2024) for a toilet fill valve replacement, or so I thought. Because my toilet was the original from 1959, it needed to be replaced. Fortunately, Nick was awesome in explaining everything that needed to be and should be done, to ensure that I would be without future problems. This job was basically an all day project since the flange also needed to be replaced. I was so happy that Nick was able to do the complete job on the day that he came out! Not only was he courteous, but he was pleasant during the whole process, including several trips back & forth to the shop which some workers would be irritated with. I will be using The Family Plumber again for my plumbing needs and I will not hesitate to ask for Nick.; Ruben and Kadin did a fantastic job for us!

The work was subpar and messy. 2 weeks later the pipes leaked and he refused to fix it. Ignored my calls and texts. I had to pay another plumber to fix his sloppy work and the leak.

We had a crack in our sewage line and other plumbers recommended a simple replacement of that section. However, Lalo recommended a replacement of the whole segment of cast iron to ABS. He let me know that cracks are usually not isolated and that this would ensure we don’t run into any other problems.

Though it was slightly more expensive than what others quoted, I’m so glad I listened to him! Lalo was able to come out the next day with a colleague and they ripped out about 20’ of old cast iron pipe. The excavated pipe was corroded and completely cracked throughout; replacing the segment, on the other plumbers recommendation, would have only caused the problem to happen again. Also, Lalo went above and beyond to replace our old clean-out with a two-way one!

Overall, I’d highly recommend American Drain Works! They’re my go-to contact now for my plumbing needs.; This review comes after several months of multiple plumbers and service workers who have attempted to diagnose the problem to no avail. 4 months later, I patiently scrolled 5 star plumbers, immediately located Ms. Connie with American Drain Works and Plumbing.

I had a plumbing emergency yesterday and even though she couldn't personally help that day due to scheduling, she still spent 30 minutes on the phone with me explaining what was going on, what I should be discussing with my landlord, and providing tips to help me with the situation moving forward. She took time out of her busy day just to empower me with knowledge and I feel so grateful. I will be recommending her to everyone I know!; Turned out I only needed a snake, but, in the time that took, Lalo gave me an education in plumbing -- to where I can see in my mind's eye how water and pipes work in my place.  Invaluable!  Now I can be more specific about a problem when I next call the wonderful Michael at the office.  Lalo did the job he was paid for, but then, beyond that, he gifted me service.

I have decided to do a hydro jet spray on my pipes around end of this year and i am definitely asking for Sebastian; Rooter Hero... you got the name right!! Don’t waste your time calling other companies like I didn’t! First call into schedule was great, spoke with a very patient and helpful young lady. Dispatcher was very pleasant as well. Jeremy Our technician arrived right when the dispatcher said he would (late evening).  He was clean cut and greeted me with a smile 8 ft from my door before  putting on his mask and booties. He assessed the situation and gave me some possible outcomes. Brought his tools inside and put down a mat where he was working. Within 20 mins he was finished, gave me the coupon special price without me even mentioning it and even cleaned up some of the mess that was there before he got there.

I had a persistent odor coming from my bathroom and the first time they came out they made suggestions to handle it myself instead of a costly repair.  It was not successful, but I appreciated it anyway.

When they did come out, they started with a sealant repair around the toilet, but then the agent, Albert Flores, got 1/2 way through and then suggested that the price to replace was almost exactly the same as to repair and that after 20+ years it was starting to look bad.

Boom!  New toilet, sealed and smelling great and more help with treatment and other questions.

These are good people."

I called several plumbing services and they all wanted to assess the problem before giving any prices and also wanted to charge a high consulting fee before hand.

All Valley Plumbing Service Inc. were the  ones to actually give me pricing right over the phone.

They were upfront and honest about pricing and services. And delivered excellent service just as they quoted over the phone.

Our plumber Moe was extremely friendly, helpful and even explained to us how to prevent plumbing issues in the future!!!

Another plumbing company had told me I needed $15,000 worth of work.  My friend had used this company and recommended it.  When I called them they were efficient and asked questions to assess what would be needed. They communicated every step of the way to let me know the technician was on the way and so forth.  They confirmed that the work needed to be done, (my laundry room had been backing up frequently) it went from a $15,000 fix to a $900 fix. They explained everything they were going to do, they why, when, and how long it was going to take. They were very prompt and the work was done quickly.  It’s unpleasant to have to spend a lot of money for unexpected home repairs.  However I was comfortable that they were doing what was necessary, and they were charging a fair price.

Went above and beyond to help diagnose the issues and stayed late to insure all issues were resolved.  Highly recommended and very pleased with professional service and effort.  A++; They arrived on time and did a competent 4 star job. My biggest issue is that they are extremely costly. To router my sink they want to change $495. When asked how long it would take, I was told only 30 minutes at the most. When asked if there were any materials or parts involved, they said there was none.

Do you believe that $495 is a reasonable price for thirty minutes of work. If you assume calculating travel time the price is at the very least $200/ hour.; I had a fantastic experience with Roto-Rooter! From the moment I booked an appt, their customer service was professional, responsive, and friendly. The technician ( Nacho ) arrived promptly, diagnosed the issue quickly, and explained everything clearly.

ChIJ08HZV5-7woARSCp0Dye_GVI,Jacob & Sons Plumbers,"5826 W Olympic Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90036",4.4,22,,N/A,"Just a couple days ago, we noticed water pooling beneath our sink. Upon inspection, I realized professional assistance was required, so I dialed up Jacob & Sons Plumbers. Much to my relief, a plumber called me back promptly and scheduled to arrive at our place by 8am the next day. True to his word, Justin showed up right on time. After assessing the problem, we decided that he would return the following morning at 7am to execute the repair. As expected, Justin was punctual and fixed the issue - the faucet was replaced, all leaks and drips were resolved. We left our house feeling secure about the plumbing situation. Every encounter I've had with the team at Jacob & Sons Plumbers has been marked by professionalism, courtesy, and expertise. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them for any plumbing concerns.; The crew at this plumbing company is highly experienced and prompt. I made a call at 7:20 am and they managed to have Justin, one of their skilled plumbers, at my place in Los Angeles by 9. They were thoughtful enough to ring me 30 minutes prior to arrival to let me know they were en route. They didn't overprice and did a superb job with our plumbing needs. We were the first to request this specific type of task from them, which involved repairing our septic pump. I would highly recommend their services. Justin was incredibly knowledgeable about the service we required and was more than willing to answer all my queries. The company is now under new management and has been providing excellent service. Thanks again, Justin and team, for your outstanding service and for finishing the job so promptly. We're thankful for your assistance.; After moving into an older house, I started dealing with serious sewer issues. I'd previously used other plumbers who misdiagnosed the problem and offered ineffective solutions. But then I got in touch with Jacob & Sons Plumbers, and they immediately identified the problem and knew how to address it correctly. They installed liners in some of the old cast iron pipes beneath my house and applied an epoxy coat to a lengthy laundry line under the slab. They also replaced parts of the severely damaged cast iron with PVC. Marc, Braxton, and Justin were incredibly professional and knowledgeable. Their work provided me with a durable, new sewer system, saving me from having to dismantle my entire house. Jacob & Sons Plumbers is definitely the place to call for sewer repairs!; i hired jacob & sons plumbers to clean the sewer lines of a house i'm purchasing before getting a scope done. their flexibility and availability are excellent, and their pricing is fair. as a first time home buyer, i don't have a deep understanding of these things, but they didn't take advantage of me. they made sure to comprehend my needs before initiating any costly task. marc, the technician who came, was both professional and honest. another plumber who came later to do the scope complimented their work, saying he'd be recommending his customers to the same service.; I've got to say, i had a pretty decent time. Justin stepped in to swap out the old water line going to my fridge's ice maker with a fresh, braided one. Not only that, but he also repositioned the shutoff valve so it's not concealed behind a cold air vent anymore. He was quick and provided good service. Definitely would suggest Jacob & Sons Plumbers in Los Angeles!"
