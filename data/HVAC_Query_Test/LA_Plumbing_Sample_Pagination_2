I had a new plumbing job that required a technician. Always sent out Amen. I am very pleased with his work. Once again Always sent a very professional technician. I am very pleased with the quick response and quality of work.; From my dad (your customer) Warlito:

‚ÄúThank you to Eric Castillo for your accurate diagnosis in restoring comfort to our home.  Eric was able to identify the plumbing issue immediately after his inspection. He discovered that the water supply to the house was 120 psi, which had busted the water heater connections and caused excessive vibrations of the pipelines.  He replaced the pressure regulating valve which solved the problem.  To Joanne & the Manager of the Company - Thank you very much for the discounts which really helped us during this difficult economic times.  As a senior on a fixed income,  this was greatly appreciated.  I definitely recommend this company and would do business with again.; Our water heater was making loud noises so we called Always Plumbing to come out to our property. We were able to have a professional on site within a few hours.

Tim came to our home and accessed our water heater for replacement.  He walked us through options on replacing our current model vs converting to a tankless water heater. We felt informed and confident when making our final selection.

Upon install, Tim and crew arrived on time and was efficient and informative upon each step. What felt like the end of the world was fixed in less than 48 hours, all thanks to Always Plumbing.

Highly recommend; Tim from the company ‚ÄúAlways Plumbing Heating and Air‚Äù is the best ever. This is not the first time we use his expertise. He‚Äôs very professional, best diagnostic and works so good on any issue you have regarding plumbing. I highly recommend wonderful fast always pluming.

ChIJsQJfnKUq3YARDVtxGvvXpQQ,Tom's Plumbing Service TPS - La Habra,"431 S Harbor Blvd, La Habra, CA 90631, United States",4.1,44,,N/A,"My husband and I were very impressed with the service we received from TPS today. Our plumber, Sergio, and his coworker showed up on time and installed two new faucets and replaced all the angle stops also.  We are senior citizens and have used many plumbing companies throughout the years and we recognize employees that are highly skilled and professional. This crew treated us and our home with great respect and charged reasonable rates.  We highly recommend this company.
Respectfully,
Rick and Vickie; I very highly recommend Tom‚Äôs Plumbing.

They are very professional and knowledgeable and came up with solutions for my almost 60 year-old plumbing that didn‚Äôt involve tearing up my floors and the disruption inside my house that would have involved.

Tom‚Äôs does very professional work, on time, and for a Reasonable price.  I called the smell good guys and one of the other companies that does all the advertising to clear out my cracked, root infested drains, and I saved a few dollars each time, only so they could sell me the lasting solutions I needed at a cost three times what I ended up paying Toms.

I‚Äôm a semi-retired CPA by profession and I know that customers are paying for all the excessive advertising expense.  When you do good work at reasonable prices you need all that expense you get word of mouth and good Yelps reiews like the one I‚Äôm leaving.

I found Tom‚Äôs because the next time my drain got clogged (maybe a month later if that) I tried to reach out to a small plumbing company that I remembered my late parents used for decades, Central Plumbing out of La Habra.  I ended up being directed to Toms because as I found out the owner of Central had retired and his business was acquired by Tom.  My parents swore by Central, so I had Tom‚Äôs come out even though they didn‚Äôt have some heavily advertised, loss leader special.

Best plumbing call I ever made By Far!

I finally broke down and did the long-term job we needed (as I said at a cost of about 1/3 what the guys that do all the advertising wanted), and now my plumbing works awesome!

I‚Äôm not worrying I‚Äôll wake up again tomorrow to go to work only to have plumbing overflowing!

If you want a great plumbing company at a fair price call Tom‚Äôs.
James was in charge of my project and he was great.  I would definitely try and arrange with Tom's to have Jame come out.

Regard,
Mark and Carla in Hacienda Heights.; First time having to call out a plumber. Called yesterday to try and schedule a visit today: but issues got worse and had to escalate to an emergency. James came  out pretty quick considering it‚Äôs Sunday, and took care of my issue. Was honest and informative. Showed me the issues and let me know what needed to be done. Not that I want to have to call a plumber, but they will be the ones I call if I ever have more issues.; If I could give the guys who came out to our park again today and the owners of this business, NO stars, I would.
We seem to have a main line issue that for as many times they've been out to our MHP, they never seem to fix it. Ergo, OUR water for the whole park is shut off. Today, it was without notice BECAUSE, last week, they were digging up a driveway and hit a gas line. They wouldn't have done so if they followed the REQUIRED PROTOCOL OF THE GAS CO, and had them come out and mark the lines. They do it for free. The Gas Co. and the City Inspector came and  shut the job down and I believe gave them some kind of fine.
This slip shod crew needs going back to plumbing school and whoever the owner is, hopefully a Licensed Plumbing Contractor, needs to as well.
If you think you can just dig everywhere you don't what is under,   you don't need to be in business because you're incompetent.  Don't come back here.; Best plumbing service!!  Rod, Tom and their crew are some of the nicest people I have ever met.  They are fair, courteous, prompt and they get the job done efficiently and are as clean as possible.  We just had to have our entire drain system redone in our home.  When I told Rod that I was getting used to my house smelling like a sewer, he immediately rectified the situation, and my house smelled clean after that.  I highly recommend these guys for any plumbing job you have, big or small."

I called several plumbing services and they all wanted to assess the problem before giving any prices and also wanted to charge a high consulting fee before hand.

All Valley Plumbing Service Inc. were the  ones to actually give me pricing right over the phone.

They were upfront and honest about pricing and services. And delivered excellent service just as they quoted over the phone.

Our plumber Moe was extremely friendly, helpful and even explained to us how to prevent plumbing issues in the future!!!

I was in desperate need to fix something (I broke) and was a bit over my head.  Short story, I had no water because of it. Thankfully Moe showed up about an hour later and repaired the water line, restoring water to the house. He was polite, respectful and professional. You can‚Äôt ask for a better plumber. Thumbs up to Moe and he‚Äôll be my first call when I need a plumber."

They couldn't do the work because it was inside of the wall and their rules around doing work at places with an HOA didn't allow them to fix the problem. I appreciate Luis heading out there and checking on it thought!; Robert and his team were fantastic - had them replace my dead tank water heater with tankless, and install a filtration system. They were thorough but quick, and were fantastic about explaining everything that was being done, and more importantly, making sure I understood necessary maintenance and upkeep.

2022:
Ford‚Äôs has fair prices that every service person has in a book for a stress free no haggle approach. They have been very effective and professional in fixing my plumbing issues and I have used them several times.; Highly recommended.

If you are looking for the absolute cheapest plumber in Los Angeles, you can stop reading here.  But I imagine if you are a homeowner, ‚Äúcheap‚Äù isn‚Äôt your top priority.  I imagine you‚Äôd rather pay a small premium to have the job done right by true professionals.

For us it was someone who ‚Äì first and foremost ‚Äì  did fantastic work and treated the job as if they were working on their own home.  And we got that from Ford‚Äôs.

When we moved into our house, we knew there was a mishmash of piping underneath.  Galvanized mixed with copper supply lines, and ABS mixed with cast iron and clay sewer lines.

Finally after several backups in our drain (that cost $250 each to clear), as well as massively reduced water pressure (and our fixtures getting clogged and ruined) due to the galvanized corrosion, we knew we had to basically re-plumb our whole house.  It was a major job.

While some people that came out to give an estimate didn‚Äôt even crawl under the home, Luis (who came out for the original bid) climbed under and took photos and measurements.  Then Robert the owner came back and worked with us for over an hour to create a comprehensive plan that not only fixed our current issues but planned ahead for future upgrades that we want to do to our house, which include moving the kitchen to the rear of the house, and adding a bathroom.  We also added a whole-house water treatment system, added a pressure regulator at the street, and epoxy-lined the sewer drain all the way out to the street connection.

Robert and his team were nice people, great communicators, easy to work with, honest, and fair.

Upon completion of the water supply line replacement, they also went through every fixture in the house to make sure they all were working properly, and they didn‚Äôt leave until everything was right. They even stayed late on the 6th day of work (a weekend) to finish the job so we could take shower that night.  It was much appreciated.

Their time estimate was also accurate.  They said 8 days and it took 8 days.

It was great to be able to trust the people working on our house to do it the right way and it was reassuring to have the same people that came out to give the estimates be the same ones doing the work (too many places have a great salesman come out to give the bid, and then send some random person back to do the work).

We still have to replace our hot water heater and add some piping when we remodel our kitchen ‚Äî and we‚Äôll definitely be giving Robert and Ford‚Äôs plumbing a call for that job.; Fords is one of the best plumbers out there. We have had them over the past 7 years redo most of house water and gas lines. Kuods to them because getting under our house, let alone working under it is a near military exercise. They have always done stellar work, and been total pros. They also tend to come out very fast. Johnnie and Luis recently came out for a for a fairly complex problem on the same day we called. Realizing the city needed to be involved, they along with Haley in the Fords office they helped walk us through the process before they could do the work. Cant recommend them more highly in an era where everyone seems to do shoddy work and phone it in."

They denied doing the plumbing even though I have an invoice from them that details the work. Again they refuse to fix their faulty work. They are costing me money, time and energy.

To their credit they showed up and fixed my gas leaks quickly. If it was done with only this it'd be a 5 star.  The things that occurred after is where it becomes a complete unprofessional experience that I am very surprised and disappointed with.

They left the old valve installed and gas company said I'd be held delinquent if they didn't remove (remove and replace the old valve was the job). They didn't show up for 3 days after I mentioned this to fix - including one no call no show. I understand things happen though so we moved on.

After they fixed it they either didn't turn the pilot light on or didn't stick around long enough to check if there was air in the pipes.

He emailed me photos proving the he was here doing the work along with the invoice, but no camera footage from snaking the line. Starting the day after, he began persistently texting me, calling me, emailing me about payment. I told him we're a corporation and payments need to go through our accounting office so give it time to process so we can cut a check. 48 hours later from the day of service I receive an email from him threatening to put a mechanics lien on the property for non-payment. In my 17 years of being in the Real Estate Business, I have never experienced a vendor so unprofessional. I tried calling to reason with him, also asking for the video of the surveillance we never received and he continued with the threats, yelling saying that we were trying not to pay him for his work and if we wanted to pay him by check we needed to be a part of some sort of vendor program with his company. I told him that if I would have known that when I initially called we wouldn't be having this problem, but he never told me that. He says he won't give us the camera surveillance that we bargained for until we pay him. Highly advise to run the other direction and find another vendor."

Technician Fernando provided an outrageous estimate of $15,000 for a plumbing repair that turned out to be a very simple fix. He didn‚Äôt even attempt to undo the faucet to properly assess the situation. Instead, it is clear that he was attempting to take advantage of me as a female homeowner by providing a grossly inflated and fraudulent estimate. After seeking a second opinion, the issue was resolved quickly for less than a fraction of the price quoted by Fernando.

ChIJga-puju_woAR5-cU1I_GxM4,Pacific Plumbing Services Inc.,"1620 Wilcox Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90028, United States",5,38,,N/A,"We needed leaking pipe repairs last Tuesday, so we phoned Velvet Plumbing. They scheduled me for Thursday, and their promised plumber showed up. Now that a new pipe has been set and fitted flawlessly, everything is operating at its best. I appreciate how quickly you responded. Really grateful that everything was completed so fast. Would highly suggest this company.; A week ago, Velvet Plumbing responded immediately to my request. The plumber they sent is a well-rounded guy and took the job seriously. The clogged toilet repair was only finished within an hour, and I'm glad that he was able to do it effectively. Indeed, a remarkable and excellent experience. Kudos and more power!; Amazing WORK! I like to commend Velvet Plumbing because not only do they provide me a stellar service but reasonably charge as well for the repair of my water line. Thanks a lot! I was very impressed with the quality of service!; There was a root problem in the common six-inch line going to the street sewer.  We called a local plumber, who cleaned out the roots and proposed a pipe lining solution to prevent further root problems.  The pipe lining solution seemed risky and high priced, so we did not pursue that.

We recently became aware of the trench-less sewer line replacement process that uses pipe bursting to pull continuous heavy polyethylene pipe into the space previously occupied by the old pipe.  Shortly after that, two of our neighbors hired Greg to replace their side sewers.  We got to see Greg perform the pipe-bursting process, and we were impressed by the process and their expertise.  The price also seemed very reasonable.

We hired Greg to do our job.   For some time I had been worried about how to do it and how much it would cost, but his method seemed like the solution.  Our job had some significant challenges that he handled with minimal complication.  He quickly solved problems that probably would have stopped people with less experience.  During the work, we were without sewer only a few hours at a time, and we always had a temporary connection most of the day and all night.  We now have a new side sewer that is better and more durable than the old concrete one.  We are completely satisfied with the quality and value of what we received, and we learned a lot.  Our experience was very consistent with all of the positive reviews on this site.; Thomas from Pacific Plumbing Services did a fantastic job installing our new water heater. We highly recommend their services."

When asked how long it would take, I was told only 30 minutes at the most. When asked if there were any materials or parts involved, they said there was none.

Do you believe that $495 is a reasonable price for thirty minutes of work.

They were great during a very difficult week for our family. Highly recommended!; The people were all very nice, but they never seemed to carry all of the equipment on their trucks, so someone else had to come out. Finally when the problem was located, they wouldn't snake it, saying we needed to tear up the driveway and replace the pipes. I had a local plumber come out and snake it, and we're fine. The bummer is, I'm out $2,380 for their diagnosis! Rooter Guard claimed that it was a collapsed pipe, but my plumber said that it was just grease and calcium build up. So glad that I didn't follow through with their suggested $4,500 ""solution!"" Be careful about their expensive solutions!"

One week later, called another company.  Walked in with booties, did the work and fixed the issue in 15 minutes for $90.  Cleaned up the mess that he made and left.  VERY PROFESSIONAL.

A few neighbors recommended Prestige Plumbing so I called Robert. His brother Richard showed up within 2 hours, carefully examined the leak and discussed with Robert. They told me that the leak was likely under the slab and they did not have the detection equipment and suggested that I found another company that had the equipment. They did not charge anything even though Richard drove 25 minutes one way from Encino. As Robert (on the phone) and Richard sounded quite straightforward, a week later when we needed to replace the water main valve, I called Robert and asked for a quote. Sure enough the price Robert gave was only 60% of what another firm quoted (and with multiple  discounts). Both brothers showed up on time and finished the job nice and clean.
We had an old house, and had used quite a few plumbing companies over the years, unfortunately it is quite rare these days to find one that is competent, honest and not greedy. Highly recommended Robert and Richard!; I recently had an issue with a leaky shower, and I'm so glad I called this plumber for help. They arrived on time, were extremely professional, and explained what needed to be done in a way that was easy to understand. The repair was completed efficiently, and the work area was left spotless afterward. The shower has been working perfectly since, with no more leaks. I really appreciated their attention to detail and the straightforward pricing. Highly recommend for any plumbing needs.
Got to give a high five to Robert and Richard.; Repair requested at 8:45am on a Friday. These guys showed up about 11:10am and performed a difficult repair in a little more than an hour, saving me from a weekend of hassle. Thanks guys. I highly recommend Prestige Plumbing Services, Inc.; Fantastic and thorough. Went beyond without charging to find the sewer issue and used his camera. Sent by American Home Shield for second opinion. Will never request anyone else.; Richard was great. Friendly and professional! Great company. A+"

They are extremely professional, communicate well, and work hard to get the job done efficiently and with a high standard of quality. Special thanks to Kevin for staying late on a Friday afternoon to finish installing the regulator on my main line so I could have my water on over the weekend.; Big League did a phenomenal job replacing my main sewer line.

My property has been modified several times over the last hundred years, but Hector (the owner) personally came out to diagnose my convoluted plumbing system and plan the best replacement strategy.

A special thanks to Jimmy, Luis, Danny, and Victor for working hard and smart so that I only went without plumbing for less than 24 hours, to Tiffany in the office for always keeping me in the loop about the status of the project, and to Hector for making the city permit process pain-free.

I will definitely be calling Big League for all my future plumbing needs.; We have now had reason to use Big League twice and have been more than satisfied both times. They showed up quickly, fixed the problems efficiently and as quoted. Their techs are friendly and explain what the problem is and how they are going to solve it. We highly recommend Big League Plumbing.; I had a great experience with Adrian and Daniel V who helped fix a pipe leak on my kitchen ceiling. The job was not trivial due to the location of the pipes, but Adrian and Daniel managed to solve the problem with confidence. They are honest and charge you a fair price for the work. I had other popular plumbers in the area wanting to charge 5x more for the work. I'm glad I went with Big League Plumbing.; Big league plumbing is truly ‚Äú major league‚Äù. I called for an emergency and they were there within hours. Mario and Lalo were efficient and professional. The pricing was very reasonable. I would highly recommend them for any plumbing services."
